\chapter{Concurrent Version System (CVS)}


The model is stored under 'CVS' on SGI computers in Trondheim.
CVS keeps track of changes, which we tag as revisions.
(Changes should also be described in the Log.changes file in the Unimod
directory).

A typical procedure is:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item
     Grab latest model code:
     \begin{itemize}
       \item
       {\bf cvs checkout Unimod}
     \end{itemize}
     \item

    \item
     User makes changes
     
    \item
     User checks for updates with {\bf cvs update}. CVS will report
     any conflicts and mark these in the code. The user has to resolve
     these by hand. (Usually not a problem).
     
    \item
     When new version available, consult administrator (Dave)

     \item 
     Either the administrator or `authorised' persons (Hilde, Peter) 'commit changes'
     \begin{itemize}
     \item
     {\bf cvs commit -m 'Sea-salt added'  Unimod}
     \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
