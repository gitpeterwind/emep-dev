EMEP 3DVar19
============

Implemented screening of observations: not analyzed if actual difference
with simulation is too different from estimated std.dev. of difference.
Output "obs" files have now integer "anstat" flag with analysis status.

Facilitate debugging: swap station codes from model to analysis domain
to allow print messages for selected stations.

Fixes of test code that is enabled using "with_ajs" macro;
now only new code in ZD_3DVarNN, not in main model.
