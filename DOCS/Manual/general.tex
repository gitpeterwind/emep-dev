\chapter{Welcome to EMEP World}

This guide gives a brief documentation of the EMEP unified model.
It is intended primarily as a guide as to how to run the model, and
to help users wishing to understand or change 
the model in terms of domains, outputs, chemistry, etc.
This guide is also intended to guide new programming with a few
simple ideas and rules.

The main documentation for the model is given in:

\begin{itemize}
\item
D.~Simpson, H.~Fagerli, J.E. Jonson, S.~Tsyro, P.~Wind, and J.-P. Tuovinen.

\section{Computer Information}

EMEP requires Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 compilers.  

The default compiler options are provided for .....

The model is tested on different platforms.  These are HP rx4640 Linux
cluster with 100 nodes, each with four Itanium2(64-bit) processors and
4GB memory; a shared memory system which consists of IBM p575+ nodes
and has a total of 62 nodes partitioned into 56 compute nodes. The
latter is well suited for large scale parallel MPI and OpenMP
applications as well as applications that combine these two
communication paradigms.   

\section{Getting Started}

Once the model is downloaded, untar the file using  the command \\

\textbf{tar -xzvf emep.tar.gz} \\

This will give you a directory called 'Unimod'.  Go to this directory
by typing 'cd Unimod' and do a listing and you will see the following
\\

\textbf{cd Unimod} \\
 \textbf{ls -lt}


\begin{verbatim}
-rwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  Makefile \\
-rwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  Changes \\
-rwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  README \\
drwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  src \\
                - Makefile   \\
                - ZD\_OZONE - ....f90 \\
                - ZD\_ACID  - ....f90 \\
                - makedepf90 - ....cpp \\
drwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  doc  \\
                - Makefile \\
                - ....tex \\
                - ....eps \\
drwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  run \\
                - ....pl  \\

\end{verbatim}

Read the 'README' first.  This has a brief note about the directory
contents.  

The src directory contains all the main .f90 files of the model and two
subdirectories called 'ZD\_OZONE' and 'ZD\_ACID' which has the
respective .f90 files of the OZONE or ACID version of the model.
Depending on which version you like to use, copy all the .f90 files
from the corresponding subdirectory into the main Unimod directory. \\

\textbf{Unimode/src$>$ cp ZD\_ACID/*.f90} .  for ACID version \\

or \\

\textbf{Unimod/src$>$ cp ZD\_OZONE/*.f90} .  for OZONE version of the model. 


The main documentation for each subroutine should be contained within
each subroutine (and updated regularly!).
