\chapter{Welcome to EMEP }

This guide gives a brief documentation of the EMEP unified model.
It is intended primarily as a guide as to how to run the model, and
to help users wishing to understand or change 
the model in terms of domains, outputs, chemistry, etc.
This guide is also intended to guide new programming with a few
simple ideas and rules.

The main documentation for the model is given in:

\begin{itemize}
\item
D.~Simpson, H.~Fagerli, J.E. Jonson, S.~Tsyro, P.~Wind, and J.-P. Tuovinen.
{The EMEP Unified Eulerian Model. Model Description}.

Meteorological Institute, Oslo, Norway, 2003.

\section{Computer Information}

EMEP requires Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 compilers.  

The default compiler options are provided for .....

The model is tested on different platforms.  These are HP rx4640 Linux
cluster with 100 nodes, each with four Itanium2(64-bit) processors and
4GB memory; a shared memory system which consists of IBM p575+ nodes
and has a total of 62 nodes partitioned into 56 compute nodes. The
latter is well suited for large scale parallel MPI and OpenMP
applications as well as applications that combine these two
communication paradigms.   

\section{Getting Started}

A tar file of the model source code can be downloaded from the web
page under the section 'Download'.   Once the model is downloaded, untar the file using  the command \\

\textbf{tar -xzvf emep.tar.gz} \\

This will give you a directory called 'Unimod'.  Go to this directory
by typing 'cd Unimod' and do a listing and you will see the following
\\

\textbf{cd Unimod} \\
          \textbf{ls -lt}


\begin{verbatim}
-rwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  Makefile \\
-rwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  Log.Changes \\
-rwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  README \\
drwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  src \\
                - ....f90
drwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  doc  \\
                - ....tex \\
                - ....eps \\
drwxr-xr-x  2 usr emep   4096 May 11 13:23 work  run \\
                - ....pl  \\

\end{verbatim}

Read the 'README' first.  This has a brief note about the directory
contents.  Makefile is the main Makefile for the model.  Each time
when the model code is updated or changed due to any reason, it is
documented in a Log file while committing the changes to CVS and this
file is stored in 'Log.Changes' file.  The src directory contains all
the main .f90 files of the model. 'doc' contains the latex code of the
'cookbook'.  Finally, the run scripts are stored under 'run'.  These
are perl scripts and a detailed description about how to handle them
is given in Chapter 4, 'Submitting a Run'.  

Each module and subroutine begins with a small documentation of the
same (and are updated regularly). Next chapter will give a detailed
insight into the necessary input files and their structure.
