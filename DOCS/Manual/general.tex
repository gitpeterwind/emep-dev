\chapter{Welcome to EMEP }

This guide gives a brief documentation of the EMEP unified model.
It is intended primarily as a guide as to how to run the model, and
to help users wishing to understand or change 
the model in terms of domains, outputs, chemistry, etc.
This guide is also intended to guide new programming with a few
simple ideas and rules.

The main documentation for the model is given in:

\section{Computer Information}

To compile the EMEP model you need:\\

\textbf{Fortran 90 compiler}

\textbf{NetCDF Library}

\textbf{MPI Library}

It is necessary to compile with double precision reals (8 bytes
reals).  The program has been tested with Intel compiler on an
Itanium2 cluster, and XL compiler on power5+ cluster; example of
Makefiles are provided. Running on different systems or with different
compilers is not expected to lead to any problem.

The code has been tested with from 1 to 128 CPU, and scales well.  If
only one CPU is used 1-2 GB memory is required and if more than one
for example 32 CPU are used, 200 MB of memory per CPU is enough (in
the case of a 170X133 grid size).

\section{Getting Started}

A tar file of the model source code can be downloaded from the web
page \url{http://www.emep.int/EMEPWebPage/EMEP_Home_Page.htm}, under the section 'Download'.   Once the model is downloaded,
untar the tar file using  the command \\

\textbf{tar -xvf Unified\_EMEP.tar} \\

This will give you a directory called 'Unify'.  Go to this directory
by typing 'cd Unify' which contains another subdirectory 'src'.  The
model source code, makefiles and runscripts are stored under this
directory.  

There are three makefiles provided.  'Makefile' is for SGI Origin 3800
computer, 'Makefile\_snow' is for an Itanium2 cluster, and the
Makefile\_njord is for an IBM power5+ cluster. The run script written
in perl, provided
herewith is called 'modrun.pl' and it is meant for an Itanium2
cluster.  A detailed description about how to handle this script
is given in Chapter 4, 'Submitting a Run'.  

Each module and subroutine begins with a small documentation of the
same (and are updated regularly). Next chapter will give a detailed
insight into the necessary input files and their structure.
