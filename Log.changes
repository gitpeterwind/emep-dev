=============================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:

After checking out new code from dev, one has to copy the appropriate
chemical mechanism files (CM) to the main directory, e.g. to get EmChem19
chemistry, run:

    mk.ChemFiles EmChem19a

  [This will copy pre-made files from ZCM_EmChem19a. The files in that directory
    are usually prepared by Dave, Robert or Alvaro, from the ecosx branch -
    ecosx/box/src directory - see the README_emep_setup.md there.) ]

2021 UPDATE: 
EmChem19r,  EmChem19rp (=EmChem19r+pollen).

  now splits PM into Res and nonRes species (e.g. POM_f_Res,
  POM_f_nonRes), which are basically tracers of GNFR C emissions.
  If you want PM split into wood/ffuel, use EmChem19a, EmChem19p

  To be used in 2021 reporting, and GP SR runs

EmChem19a was previously the default chemistry for most emep jobs, and should
  still be used where the distinction wood/ffuel is wanted.

EmChem19p is just EmChem19a + Alvaro's pollen species.

MAKE sure that SplitDefaultFile  and SplitSpecialsFile  point to
the appropriate place, DataDir/ZCM_DIRS/ZCM_EmChem19.

Soil NOx - NOW COMPLICATED since some inventories include already include soil NOx:

  USES%SOILNOX_METHOD - needs user decision!
    NoFert       - for EMEP, ECLIPSEv6
    Total        - ok for CAMS_REG_ANT, ECLIPSEv5

** See new config SOILNOx system, rv4.42



=============================================================================
!----------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN-UP: all code should be checked to remove old comments before
the public release. Ideally compile code on PC with gfortran's
pedantic debug switches (eg make MACHINE=precise EMEP) - gives loads of
info on unused variables, etc.

Can define a file with timefactors defined every day of the year instead of
monthly+weekly factors.
Usage example, in config_emep.nml:
  USES%DAYOFYEARTIMEFAC = T,
  DayofYearFacFile ='/home/sm_alvva/EMEP/time_factors_2020/no_lockdown.POLL',

Bug in DegreeDays when a country used the timefactors from another country,
the DD would not work, i.e. give only hourly variation, but constant between all days.

In Europe, it is only RUX (Russian Fed. outside emep) which is affected,
so no dramatic changes (this is only domestic sector, and sums over a year are still correct).

fac_min(iland,tfac_idx,iem) should be  fac_min(iland_timefac,tfac_idx,iem)
fac_min(iland,tfac_idx,iem)=1.0 (dfault) for countries which do not have a
monthly factor defined for themselves, as RUX.

Changed the printout of model level heights using Pref instead of P0.
WRF use P0= 100000Pa. Which means a surface pressure much lower than a standard
atmosphere(!). Using P0, gave a surface with height 110m, which is confusing.
Does the P0 from WRF actually mean something?

The results (pollutants etc.) should be unchanged anyway: P0 is a local
variable, not used after the printout of model heights.

maximum daily eight-hour mean concentration

Following page 24 note (2)
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:152:0001:0044:EN:PDF

The maximum daily eight-hour mean concentration shall be selected by examining
eight-hour running averages, calculated from hourly data and updated each hour.
Each eight -hour average so calculated shall be assigned to the day on which it
ends. i.e. the first calculation period for any one day will be the period from
17:00 on the previous day to 01:00 on that day; the last calculation period
for any one day will be the period from 16:00 to 24:00 on the day.

Can be used with for example (in config_emep.nml):
OutputMisc=
   'MaxD8M_O3', 'MaxD8M', '',  'O3', 'ug/m3', -1 , -1,   F,    1.0,   F, 'YMD',

New optimization flag in Makefile. Tested on Nebula. Can give 25% improvement
in runtime!

(cut from a mail to Heiko:)
Test on Nebula, EMEP01, 6 hours, 8*32 CPUs.
times: total within loops

 -O2  -ftz 38.3
 -O2  -ftz -ipo 38.9
 -O3  -ftz 38.7
 -O2  -ftz -march=core-avx2 -ipo 33.4

 -O2 -xcore-avx512 -ftz -ipo 36.5
 -O3 -xcore-avx512  -ftz 38.7
 -O2 -xcore-avx512 -ftz 37.1
 det er omtrent 1 sekund random usikkerhet i tallene)

Så det ser ut som ipo og O3 forverre tiden, mens avx2 er nyttig. Litt rart at avx512 blir verre igjen.
Omtrent 10 sekunder av tallene er i/o, som (ofte) blir relativt lite for lengre kjøringer. Dvs at for resten går man fra ca 28.3 til 21.8 (med -O2  -ftz -march=core-avx2), = 23% forbedring i kjøretid

På den andre siden, har jeg også gjort noen tester med nye Local Fractions som har veldig tung (vectorisert) kjemi loop. og der blir:

-O2  -ftz 429.7
-O2  -ftz -march=core-avx2 -ipo 416.3
-O2  -ftz -march=core-avx2 352.8
-O3 -xcore-avx512  -ftz  -ipo 360.5
-O2 -xcore-avx512 -ftz 325.4

Så her er det en del å hente med avx512!

Just prepping for futire Tleaf calculations:

Biogenics_mod.f90 - uses Grid%dTleaf, though this is currently zero

Config_mod.f90 - added TLEAF_FROM_HD, TLEAF_FROM_RN, both .false. for
                 future usage.

Derived_mod.f90 - added dTleafHd, dTleafRn outputs as MISC. Also corrected
                  indentation of some "end forall"

Io_Progs  - misleading initial text removed (claiming F-compliance).
          - datewrite_iia improved using advance='NO' construct to avoid

BUG-FIX: SoilWater_mod was setting all fSW to 1.0!! Also changed DEBUG_SOILWATER
 to DEBUG%SOILWATER. Fixes in:

 Debug_mod.f90
 Met_mod.f90
 SoilWater_mod.f90
 SubMet_mod.f90

USES%WETRAD added as option to trigger use of wet-radius and density in
  aerosol settling velocity (Vs) calculations. Only really affects coarse
  sea-salt.
 
  Default is .false. for now to preserve rv4.43 results, but will be set .true.
  very soon, after further tests and maybe another tweak or two.

   Changes in:
    config_emep.nml - added USES%WETRAD for clarity.
    Config_mod.f90 - just added WETRAD in USES structure
    DryDep_mod.f90 - uses USES%WETRAD

  Note: current system tests both wet and dry Vs just to compare in debug output.
  A more CPU effective vesion would only calculate the one needed.
  Also, the USES option will be removed once we are happy that everything works
  well. Settling velocity should use the wet radius and density.

NEW tag:rv4.43

Changes to update POD calculations to 2017 Mapping Manual (MM):
(Results don't change very much at all, except slight degrade in O3 and
 new veg for POD.)

1) added PODscale and SMIcrit params to do3se(iLC) type
    and also special treatment for IAM_SNL_MED

  Impacts:

   AOT40nPOD_mod.f90 - uses PODscale
   DO3SE_mod.f90 - added PODscale and SMIcrit
                   and L%g_sto = min( do3se(iLC)%g_max, 550.0) - for IAM_SNL_MED

   DataDir/Input_LandDefs_Sep2021, with map of (approx) Meditteranean


2) Use of mask for (approx) Meditteranean, and of topography for SGS, EGS

    - medMap_0.5deg.nc
    - updates LandDefs, DO3SE with new MM IAM vegs

  Config_module.f90 - reads LandCoverInputs%mapMed
  Landuse_mod.f90   - routine updateSGSmaps corrects SGS, EGS for topography

  DryDep_mod.f90 - calls updateSGSmaps to change SGS, EGS

3) Introduced fSW40, fSW50 and fSW90 for different veg. Impacts:

  CellMet_mod.f90
  LocalVariables_mod.f90
  MetFields_mod.f90
  SoilWater_mod.f90

Added the "RESTART" option for NEST. This is to be used when one restart a run
without changing the domain size ("checkpoint-restart").
The difference with "START" is only that BC are not overwritten. This is important 
In the case of restarting exactly at the start of a month (at time 00:00, the 1st),
because the nest file had the BC from preceding month, and it will otherwise
use old month BC.

Core parts of the full chemistry setup for Local Fractions.
Runs the chemistry loop many time to make numerical derivatives.

Small bug in NMHC output fixed: TERPO2 removed from NMVOC group (SHL species
  cannot be used in group output, so no RO2 species can be included. Their
   concentrations should be very small though.)

NAME changes:
  ZCM_EmChem19rnr  renamed to ZCM_EmChem19r
  ZCM_EmChem19rnrp renamed to ZCM_EmChem19rp

Consistent NMVOC, and without PAN, MPAN in NMVOC_GROUP:
  ZCM_EmChem19r, ZCM_EmChem19rp, ZCM_EmChem19a, ZCM_EmChem19p

DryDep_mod, Config_module

  - added USES%NO2_COMPENSATION_PT to mimic old behaviour if SOILNOX=F.
    Only for testing, and will be removed soon!

Makefile adapted for Betzy

EmisGet_mod: changed tmp_emisfrac from automatic to allocatable array, because

Gridded hourly timefactors.
Config setting should be of format for example:
hourly_emisfac(1)%file = 'Emis-hfactorYYYYMMDD.nc',
hourly_emisfac(1)%cdfname = 'NOx_emis_factor',
hourly_emisfac(1)%poll = 'nox',

hourly_emisfac(2)%file = 'Emis-hfactorYYYYMMDD.nc',
hourly_emisfac(2)%cdfname = 'PM_emis_factor',
hourly_emisfac(2)%poll = 'pm25',

and the file must have 24 records starting from 00:00

LocalFractions for pm25:
Now treats the pm25 "chemistry" (new->age) exactly by default.
The pm25 are then divided into two groups, new species and the remainder.
The cost is then only twice (was seven times when each species
needed to be treated separatly and needed to sum then in the postprocessing)

The non-chemistry pm25, can be required by requiring the "pm25_tot" species
(useful it one does not want to pay twice the price, and accept the small
differences).

RE-TAG: rv4.42

ZCM_EmChem19rnrp added - same as EmChem19rnr below, but with Pollen too.

On DataDir, ZCM_DIRS/ZCM_EmChem19/emissplits_gnfr/CAMS-REG-AP_v4_2_yr2017_REF2_1
  was copied to rnr-suffixed: CAMS-REG-AP_v4_2_yr2017_REF2_1 _rnr, to make it
  clear that ony EmChem19rnr type chem schemes can be used.
  Will delete non-suffixed version after some days.

ZCM_EmChem19a -   Update: CM_ChemGroups now has NMVOC, NMHC groups. 
                          NMVOC species removed.

ZCM_EmChem19rnr added - has Res and nonRes species (e.g. POM_f_Res, POM_f_nonRes),
                        which are basically tracers of GNFR C emissions.
                        CM_ChemGroups: now has NMVOC, NMHC groups, from EmChem19a

config_emep.nml - added commented out link to Ref 2.1 with Res/nonRes emissions,
                  under ZCMDIR/emissplits_gnfr/CAMS-REG-AP_v4_2_yr2017_REF2_1

26th May 2021, Dave/Peter/Agnes

1. SOILNOx emissions system improved (gridded 3h steps), and simplified to just:

  USES%SOILNOx            ! T or F
  USES%SOILNOx_METHOD     ! Total, NoFert, Zaehle2011, or OLD_EURO
  soilnox_emission_File   ! cams81 or Zaehle files

  Changes in:
    Biogenics_mod
    Config_module
    Emissions_mod
    NetCDF_mod

2. config_emep.nml

  Simpler system started. The complex bit involving emissions, domain,
   soil-NOx is now at the top, and needs user-decisions. Many other
   settings removed if the defaults are fine. Comments/suggestions welcome
   for further improvements.

  GridValues_mod, emep_Main: commented out set_EuropeanAndGlobal_Config

3. Volcano files updated in Config_module:

   volcano_emission.csv_20210525, volcano_location.csv_20210525


4. TRONKz is now TROENKz, = default (renamed after Troen ;-)

  BLPhysics
  Config_module
  config_emep.nml

5. NEW FILE: GravSettling_mod.f90: Code added as EXPERIMENTAL ONLY. Do not use yet.

  Affects:
    Makefile.SRCS 
    Config_module.f90 - USES%GRAVSET = .false.
    PhyChem_mod.f90 - calls grav settling if USES%GRAVSET

6. Small tidy-ups:
     AeroFunctions_mod, Setup_1d_mod
  
7. IAM_CROP added to LandInputs_May2021 files and config_emep.nml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
21st May 2021, Dave
NEW TAG: rv4.41

1. AeroFunctions_mod, SeaSalt_mod, Setup_1d_mod:

   Merged WetRad calcs into GerberWetRad, and added RH limits for different PM types.
   Simplified tab to 2 pm types.
   (changes results a little, but mainly pmH2O)

2. Changed default config options

 Config_module:
  Defaults changed:
    TIMEZONEMAP      = .true.
    SEASALT_fFrac = 0.5

  Removed: SURF_AREA_RHLIMITS

 config_emep.nml
  Removed: SURF_AREA_RHLIMITS completely

3. fracPM25 now changed to use LogNormFrac below. Reduced from 27% to 13%, so
   small reduction in PM25, but only really affects NO3_c

4. Log.changes - added Soil NOx comments to IMPORTANT NOTES above

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20th May 2021, Dave

Biogenic_mod:  small additions to help printouts
Config_module: small additions to help testing
Derived_mod: added fPMc_specs NO3 test line

SubMet_mod: added use of PBL%NEUTRAL_USTAR_START for SEI testing
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19th May 2021, Peter/Dave

SoilNox in the GLOBAL_SOILNOX case were counted twice, once in setup_1d and
once in setup_bio! The SoilNox from setup_1d is now removed.

SoilNox in the GLOBAL_SOILNOX case are now read/converted into molecules/m2/s
instead of molecules/cm3/s as before, then converted into molecules/cm3/s in
setup_bio.

Also moved the sumation of emissions into a new routine sum_rcemis, so that it
contains also the emission set by setup_bio

Timefactors_mod, config_emep.nml

  bug fix on use of MonthlyFacBasis. ALL NEEDS CLEARER/SAFER system.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16th May 2021, Dave/Svetlana

SeaSalt, SoilNOx, Emissions changes

1. Sea-Salt: 

 Config_mod, SeaSalt_mod

  USES%SEASALT_fFrac  added to split 7th emission mode into fine & coarse
  Set to zero to capty´ure "old" method. New default will be 0.5
  Also, git didn't like the å in Mårtenson, so I used aa instead. (From
  some Windows encoding maybe?)

2. SoilNOx:

 This is COMPLICATED. CAMS81_SOILNOX provides monthly soil NOx from 4
 types of emissions source, of which one of fertilizer-induced. Such
 emissions are included in some inventories (EMEP!, ECLIPSEv6), but not
 others (CAMS_REG_ANT, ECLIPSEv5). Thus, the user needs to know and set
 properly!

 Config_mod, Emissions_mod

  USES%SOILNOX_METHOD - needs user decision!
    CAMS_NoFert  - for EMEP, ECLIPSEv6
    NOTSET       - ok for CAMS_REG_ANT, ECLIPSEv5

  (will likely change NOTSET to "wFert" for these latter emissions, to force
   the user to make a choice.)

 Emissions_mod
   Use of USES%SOILNOX_METHOD to get either all CAMS81 emissions or just
   the non-Fertilizer ones.

3. MonthlyFactors

 Config_mod, Timefactors.f90

  1. New ECLIPSE-based MonthlyFac files created and stored on DataDir
  2. MonthlyFacBasis added to Config system. Set as GENEMIS for "old"
     MonthlyFacs, or "ECLIPSE" for new.
  3. MonthlyFacBasis is used in  Timefactors to prevent summer/winter
    ratio scaling for ECLIPSE case. (The GENEMIS data were from 1994,
    so needed scaling to get to year 2000-ish ratios. ECLIPSE data should
    not be scaled like this.

4. EmisDef_mod

    made SNAP8 height index same as for GNFR - giving more elevated ship
    (+train/plane!) emissions



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14th May 2021, Peter

Bug in DryDep for treatment of vg_eff. Sub(0)%Vg_eff was not properly initialized.
There is an initialization in CellMet_mod.f90, Sub(:)          = ResetSub
However ResetSub does not explicitely set value of Vg_eff. However since ResetSub
is defined by compiler, it is likely to be zero(?).
I did not notice any change in results.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
13th May 2021, Dave
NEW MODULE: Io_RunLog_mod.f90

Simple move of PrintLog routine from the Io_Progs_mod, to avoid
circularity problems in some other modules, plus addition of logtxt
variable to help internal-write usage in calling routines. (Io_Progs_mod
had grown beyond its intended simple routines, and all the dependencies
were causing problems.

Changes in all modules that had "use Io_Progs_mod" for PrintLog.

Most code changes in GridValues:

  adding output of USES%CAMS81_SOILNOx and PFT_MAPS to final settings.
  use of logtxt for internal-writes before call to PrintLog

Plus PrintLog commented out in Io_Progs_mod.

30th April 2021, Michael/Peter/Dave

GNFR_H, Aviation, are now outputted into a new vertical distribution, with
50% below 50 m, and the rest evenly distributed up to 1106 m.

The Emission heights levels are now defined in meters, and the default levels
are rounded to zero decimals:
     Emis level    1         20.0 m      101085.0 Pa
     Emis level    2         50.0 m      100725.8 Pa
     Emis level    3         92.0 m      100224.7 Pa
     Emis level    4        184.0 m       99134.0 Pa
     Emis level    5        324.0 m       97492.8 Pa
     Emis level    6        522.0 m       95209.3 Pa
     Emis level    7        781.0 m       92287.8 Pa
     Emis level    8       1106.0 m       88725.0 Pa

NB: those will slightly change concentrations (but not total emission columns)!

   DMS%FileFound replaces OCEAN_DMS_FOUND

Emissions_mod, MassBudget_mod - use of DMS%FileFound
Setup_1d_mod: New equations added

RESULTS WILL CHANGE with new defaults. Use KzNew=F, ScNew=F, emis from DMS.nc

Added pmH2O outputs from from Gerber system, and added USES%SURF_AREA_RHLIMITS
to restrict RH range of Gerber cals to goven RH (in %). Use of -1 (default) or 100 
equivalent to current system, but will need changing soon!

** PROBLEM identified: coarse sea-salt can generate enormous (>1000 ug/m3)
  pmH2O at 100% RH.  Need to decide if 98 or 99% will be best thresholds.

AeroFunctions: modified self_test and some QUERY comments 
ChemFields_mod: use now pmH2Ogb for Gerber water for f and c (LIMAX*LJMAX*2)
Config_module: Added SURF_AREA_RHLIMITS  = -1; will be set to 98 or 99 soon!
Setup_1d_mod:  use and output of pmH2O and USES%SURF_AREA_RHLIMITS. Also tidy up
               and one QUERY added.
config_emep.nml - added pmH2O outputs

Enabled CAMS81 soil NOx for testing. Not yet default, but can be enabled with
  config settings:

 config_emep.nml - added explicit:
  !UNCOMMENT for new CAMS81 SOILNOX
  !  USES%EURO_SOILNOX = F,
  !  USES%GLOBAL_SOILNOX = T,
  !  USES%CAMS81_SOILNOX = T,
  !  USES%SOILNOX = T,

IMPORTANT: Careful with above. More safety checks will be added in future, and USES%EURO_SOILNOX

Biogenics_mod - added hourlySoilFac for global SOILNOx

Config_module - added nox_emission_cams81File: DataDir/cams81_monthly_SoilEmissions_v2.2_GLOBAL05_2000_2018.nc'
  code is basically a copy of nox_emission_1996_2005File

NEW TAG: rv4.39

Heavy refactoring of the sectors setups.
GNFR_CAMS is now the default normally. Although the "SECTOR_NAME" is removed
from code, since it is open to really mix sectors if one wants (i.e. without
necessarily mapping sectors to either SNAP or GNFR).
One can easily add new sectors through config_emep.nml, see documentation.

The EmisHeights.txt file is removed, now included in the code. It can also be
set in config_emep.nml, see documentation.

Although a lot has changed, the results should be the same, if used correctly.

Bug: tag for mpi could overflow. The mpi tag has a max value which is guaranteed
to be at least 32767, but is in practice much larger (millions). Some installation
had max set to 524287, and then if lots of things are outputted (for example nesting
hourly), this could get too large, and the code crashes.

Also removed some unused "include mpif.h", and put a default case in Makefile
for gfortran installations (ubuntu etc.).

1. Default MonthlyFacFile now DataDir/Timefactors/MonthlyFacs_eclipse_V6b_snap_xJun2012/MonthlyFacs.POL

   - which merges non-European facrors derived fro ECLIPSE6b with European from Jun2012

2.  Timezone handling improved - uses Monthly_timezoneFile =

  USES%TIMEZONEMAP       = T,

Sets "proper" timezones for countries which have -100 flag. Also takes care of
summer time for e.g. Europe for all countries.

Changes in:
  Config_module
  EmisGet_mod
  Emissions_mod
  Timefactors_mod

Met_mod, Config_mod:

Small modification for PBL%KzMethod: use "Mixed" and not "-"  to get previous
default. This is to avoid incorrect names (e.g. "TR") dropping through the
if-tests without the user being aware. Now, anything which isn't defined
results in a call to StopAll.

Also recoded this section to use select case PBL%KzMethod rather than
if-tests. (Seemed neater.)

24th Feb 2021, Dave

Moved various PBL param definitions from BLPhysics to Config_mod PBL type:
  NWP_Kz, USE_MIN_Kz, KzMethod, UnstableKzMethod, StableKzMethod


Debug_mod: more variables moved from _XXX to %XXX system: BL, Kz, EMISTIMEFACS
           -> changes in Config_mod, Emissions_mod, Timefactors_mod,

NetCDF_mod - reduced printout from all nodes

(MOVING towards rv4.38, which will have Qing+Bruce's Troen as default)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15th Feb 2021, Qing, Bruce

New KzMethod TRONKz and SILAMKz. TRONKz is used as new default.
You can set KzMethod="TRONKz" in BLPhysics_mod.f90.
Previous default is KzMethod="--" (different KzMethod in stable and unstable conditions).

New HmixMethod default JcRb_t2m, based on JcRb HmixMethod but change the formulation of the stable condition.
You can set HmixMethod = "JcRb_t2m" in Config_module.f90.
Previous default is HmixMethod = "JcRb".

New HmixMethod JcRb_surfT is also available in the code but commented out, as surface/skin temperature is not always in met files.
When surface/skin temperature is available, it should replace JcRb_t2m.

RESULTS changing!! Will change tag soon!

1. Changes which modify results a little!
   - remove calc of Idirect, Idiffuse, and use coszen to define daylight. Completes
     moved to WiessNorman

 Changes in: PhyChem, Rsurface_mod

vpd calculations :
  rh2m (from NWP) now used in deposition calculations, instead of latent heat calculation
  Simplifies the code, and seems more consistent with use of T2m from NWP,
  and as we have only grid-average LE to work with.
  Added USES%RH_FROM_NWP in Config_mod for this.

 Changes in: Config_mod, Submet_mod

2. Other changes:

MIN_USTAR_LAND (default 0.1 m/s) moved from BLPhysics to PBL% in Config
 changed hard-coded Grid%ustar to min 0.1 in CellMet to PBL%MIN_USTAR_LAND  also.
 CHECK later if sea-values affected by this?

 Changes in: BLPhysics_mod, CellMet_mod, Met_mod

Derived_mod:
  Added CloudFrac possibility, though using  quck n dirty MISC method

Smaller changes:
  config_emep.nml -  fixed some comment lines for DEBUG
  DryDep_mod - tidied debug output
  Io_Progs - added "afmt" option to datewrite as optional argument. Still
   needs work, but doesn't affect previous usage.
  LandDefs - longer name and code strings
  Landuse_mod - more debug output (for SEI)
  Radiation_mod - changed comment
  Setup_1d_mod - removed ancient "use" for S_RiemnerN2O5
  StoFlux_mod - more debug, using new afmt flag to datewrite.

Two bugs in Timefactors in reading hourly factors.
The "inputline" was only 200 char long, and if this is exceeeded (which can
be when writing 24 real numbers) the last timefactors would be set to zero.
The normalization of the factors for daynumber zero (all) was only normalizing
Monday.

In specific cases the interpolation in ReadField_CDF fails.
So far the only case found was a 0.011x0.011 degree latlon grid, when DMS
(1 degree grid) is interpolated ("conservative" interpolation),
the rightmost part of the domain was showing zero emissions of DMS.
(Happens when the left side of a DMS gridcell is outside the domain and
the right side is outside the local subdomain)
Fixed now.

Also small optimization of LF

EmChem19a, EmChem19p - chemistry updated to match GenChem v1.0

Changes are small, mainly due to re-ordering, but with:

  pNO3 replacing TNO3 for NO3_f + NO3_c
  skipping terpPeroxy in latest code.
  new style csv files for emissplits for EmChem19a

tag updated to rv4_36, prior to Oct 2020 OS

Sites_mod:
     Tightened checks for "Coords" KeyValue.
     Can now have LatLonKdown, LatLonZm, LatLonHrel or IJKdown.
     Older LatLong option will now crash with error message.

     Much use of new DEBUG%SITE to reduce excessive outputs
     Hmix out now enabled

config_emep.nml added Hmix and other outputs for Sites D2D usage

Config_mod:
   EFFECTIVE_RESISTANCE now set true. (It was accidentally true anyway!)

Debug_mod: Added DEBUG%SITE to give site name (or part of name)

DryDep_mod:
   Bug-fix: EFFECTIVE_RESISTANCE was effectively set true by default.
   logic now corrected, but will set .true. in Config_mod. Tests show
   that effects are only small so far.

SmallUtils_mod:
   Started to  add more debug to investibate str_replace.

Also: DataDir/sitesLL.dat and sondesLL.dat copied to sitesLLKD.dat and sondesLLKD.dat
 and Coord names updated.

Changed NO3 photolysis for mechanisms including IDNO3_NO and/or IDNO3_NO2 (e.g. CRIv2R5Em)

DefPhotolysis_mod.f90
Setting:
            rcphot(IDNO3_NO,:) = 0.127 * rcphot(IDNO3,:)
            rcphot(IDNO3_NO2,:) = 0.873 * rcphot(IDNO3,:)

The fractions 87.3% NO2-path and 12.7% NO path are based on relative photolysis speeds in MCM.

Earlier version used IDNO3_NO = IDNO3 and IDNO3_NO2 = IDNO3 (which means total NO3
photolysis was too fast and the relative fraction of NO product was too large).

Sites_mod.f90:

1. New option for  VertCoords: LatLonHrel

 This builds on Peter's LatLonZ option, though now the user provides Hrel,
 the relative height in meters. The calculation of z_topo is still used
 to get the model's grid-average height, but the site is now located
 at Hrel+z_topo.

 The advantage of Hrel over Z is that the resulting mode level used
 is independent of the EMEP domain in use.  Hrel as a concept typcally
 uses height above the lowest terrain  within 5km, and so is a sub-grid
 phenomena.  This can be calculed from a digitial elevation map, or
 local knowledge.

2. More info on site location now output to sites.csv, e.g.:

 42  sites in domain  12 132   1 111 InpCoords: LatLonHrel
  1 Hours between outputs
name                                         lat     lon,    ix,    iy,    iz, z_site, ztopo
DK0012R_Risoe                           ,   55.694,   12,    48,    57,    20,    44,    41
FI0096G_Pallas_(Sammaltunturi)          ,   67.973,   24,    35,    84,    17,   628,   325

This shows the option chosed (here LatLonHrel), the lat, lon,

 output coordinates (ix,iy) are now for the output RUNDOMAIN, not the
 full-domain (meteo) coordinates previouslty output. Thus, Risoe here
 should be locaed at 48, 57 in the output Base_fullrun.nc.

 iz gives the model level used. This is calculated for LatLonZ and LatLonHrel cases.
 z_site gives the site altitude or rel. altiude as given in inputs (-9999 for LatLon case)
 ztopo  gives the grid-average altitude.

NB extra outputs for ascii outputs only.
 formatting of output still a little tricky. Long station names produce error
 (easily fixed, but then formats need tweaking.)

ToDo: Would be great to output for exact coordinate, using bilinear
 interpolation of surrounding cells. For example Birkenes is almost on
 the edge of two cells in the EECCA domain.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

SitesLL.dat can give elevations in meters.
The header should mention

Bug in MARS, rpmares. We assumed that mass of NH3+NH4  (or NO3+HNO3),  is conserved
while it is only the number of molecules which is conserved.

old version:
TNH4 = MAX( 0.0, (NH3 / MWNH3 + NH4 / MWNH4)  )
TMASSNH3  = MAX(0.0, NH3 +  NH4 )

...

ANH4_High = min( YNH4 * MWNH4, TMASSNH3 )  !ASSUMES NH4 cannot be larger than TMASSNH3!!
GNH3_High = TMASSNH3   - ANH4_High  !ASSUMES ANH4 + GNH3_High (in kg) is conserved!!


Replaced two lines  with:

ANH4_High = min(  YNH4 , TNH4 )* MWNH4
GNH3_High = max(FLOOR,(TNH4 - YNH4))*MWNH3

Since the mass(NH3)=17, mass(NH4)=18, mass(NO3)=62, mass(NO3)=63, so the error
is about <6% for NH4 and <1.5% for NO3


(also some additional changes for local fractions)

Interpolation failed for GLOBAL_LAInBVOC.nc in GLOBAL05 runs.
The reason is a combination of many factors:
both grid have same resolution, but shifted by half a gridcell. The "nearest"
neighbor (zero order interpolation) is just in between two gridcells, and at
the end of the map it chose the "wrong side".
Solution: we force the index to be within range.

13th Dec 2019, Peter

Small bug in interpolation routine: in the case of zero order interpolation,
lat lon, and the data does not cover the entire model grid, the results may
be dependent on the number of CPUs.
This does not happen with standard inputs.
Now values are set to Undef in this case. (Earlier it would take in practice a
random point within the defined values)

New emission format: the combination GNFR new emissions with SNAP sector
defintions did not work properly. Redefined gnfr2snap, where values are
negative if repeated. In loops over "all sectors" (read all sectors) only
positive values are taken, so that nothing is used twice. If values are
added (convert from gnfr to snap), the absolute value is taken.

Further CMX'ing:

ZCM_DIRS on DataDir now stores new-style files. Currently for EmChem19

ZCM_EmChem19a, ZCM_EmChem09

*** GenChem upgrade :-)

The code has been modified in various places to cope with the new GenChem
system. The largest changes are:

*** NEW **
Use of text (not .inc) files for boundary and BiomassBurning now
replaces older .inc files. Main advantage is that one can simply
append series of files from different mechanisms, eg adding
basic gas-phase, sea-salt, dust, PM, as requested by the user
(via GenChem)

CMX_BoundaryConditions.txt now replaces CM_BoundaryConditions.inc, and uses
a simple mapping table of strings, e.g.

  # globBC     emep             fac  wanted
  #
    'O3      ','O3      '   ,   1.0, T
    'HNO3    ','HNO3    '   ,   1.0, T


BoundaryConditions_mod - now reads table  from CMX_BoundaryConditions
together with defBICs definitions for mapping.  Removed IBC_NO etc.

ForestFire_mod - now reads tables  from CMX_BiomassBurning files.
Some harmonisation of mapping routines for FINN and GFAS.

CMX_BiomassBurning_FINNv1p5.txt and CMX_BiomassBurning_GFASv1.txt
(stored in GenChem system) now replace older .inc files.

EmisGet - uses any_case when reading emissplit

mk.ChemFiles uses the new system.

ZCMDIR now added in config_emep.nml, Config_module.f90
(eg ZCMDIR="ZCM_EmChem19a")


ZCM_EmChem19a - updated species settings also (from Robert/ecosx).
ZCM_EmChem19  - updated species names etc
ZCM_EmChem09  - updated to CMX (for FINNv1p5 and GFASv1 anyway)

SmallUtils - added xcindex funtion to return index of substr in string
   regardless of case. (e.g. matches DUST in Dust_road.)

Biogenics_mod - small debug change

NOTE: The CMX files should be placed in the appropriate ZCMDIR (probably
on DataDir, e.g. ZCM_EmChem19). Done on stallo only so far.)

USES treatment expanded to almost all USE_ variables.

Config_module:

  WriteConfig_to_RunLog routine added -
     called at end of run.  Writes out the USES settings as they
      were actually used.

  Output of full ModelConfig namelist to RunLog.out commented out.
  Could be sent elsewhere (config.out maybe?), but a RunLog of 35000 lines
  was not readable, and this did not show if USES varuables had been
  changed.

  I would prefer that we build up a tidy output of the ModelConfig, but
  it isn't obvious how to do it yet. Might just need hard-coded lines to
  print out the important information, skipping all unused or unset values.

Added EmChem19a chemistry scheme -- a slightly revised version of EmChem19

Main difference: MACR is used to represent both methacrolein (MACR) and methyl
vinyl ketone (MVK).
[The first EmChem19 had both, but the treatment was a bit inconsistent]

Minor updates of reaction rates for APINENE+O3 and APINENE+OH (the second rate
was inconsistent in the previous version).

Bug fix for wet deposition parameters for gas phase fraction of VBS-species.
[previous version had WD-parameter set to PMf, which gave much more efficient
in-cloud scavenging]

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
31 Oct 2019, Robert

Bug (sort of) in YieldModifications_mod.f90 fixed.

The SOA yields for benzene and toluene were inconsistent with the SOA yields
for other VOCs (including OXYL) when using YieldModifications = 'VBS-T10'.

The yields for benzene and toluene were too large (based on Hodzic et al., 2016)
when including SOA aging (which is included in the "standard" model version).

If anyone for some reason want to use the old (erroneous/inconsistent) SOA yields
it can still be done by setting
YieldModifications = 'VBS-T10old'
in the config file

21-22 Oct 2019, Peter

Bug in ReadField_CDF. In case of emissions defined on a limited are (like TNOIII),
the left most gridcells of the emissions would not always be included.

Small cleanups:
Timestep for chemistry was buggy (crash) if dt_advec=150.
In a global run, if there are too many MPI, so that the domain cannot be cutted

New format emissions: if species in not found, it will also look for species with
other lower/upper cases
New format emissions: implemented femis in lonlat format.

Now longitudes from femislonlat can go around the entire globe (but still
cannot cross -180, if not the entire globe is included).

Complete deep revision of convection.
The method is now mostly rewritten and base on mixing ratios.
It does not try to keep the sigma coordinate formalism.
There were probably bugs in the old version. (subsidence counted twice? and
wrong flux limitations)

It should be stable and safe now, however the CONVECTION_FACTOR should be
redefined.

When a new variable 'ps' is defined by user, it can mess with the 'PS' already defined,
see Issue #160. Now the variable is first looked for with case sensitive search,
then case insensitive if not found.

Bug in find_index: any_case=.true. and any_case=.false. had same effect, since
only presence was tested.

New output: pressure_3D. for 3D pressure output set for instance in config:

The pollName restrictions for emission was not working correctly (worked only
if "sox" was among pollNames!).

The bugfix had implications for the "non fraction" cases, and it has not been

ZCM_EmChem19 introduced. (EmChem16ziVBS2012 in RB's testing system)
This scheme has been thoroughly tested against MCM and performs better
in box model tests than EmChem16. (Differences will be smaller in emepctm.)

To use:

1. Compile:
   mk.ChemFiles EmChem19
   make clean
   make

2. Make sure that DataDir has an emissplit directory ZCM_EmChem19 on DataDir (exists
   on vilje and stallo 7th June).

3. Edit config_emep.nml - uncomment the "Split" lines to point to that directory

4. Run, and check ;-)

Country  DE 0      0.0   1.0   1.0   1.0  1.0   1.0  1.0

IMPORTANT (for PODs):

  DO3SE_mod - bug fix on PAR enabled (keep OLDBUG fflag for comprisons)

Convenience:
  Derived_mod - changed HORIZ_LINE to avoid f2003 new_line
  SmallUtils_mod - added (back) str_replace.  I find it more intuitive than key2str.

rv4_33beta tag started ... results will change over coming days...


Derived_mod - calls Reset_3dOrganic to harmonise OM25_p and SURF_ugPM_OM25
              Fixes problem found by Hilde that OM25_p >= ugPM_OM25, by
              more conistent cfac usage, and now produces mixed-phase
              outputs if ug_PM not specified.
              All very messy though, and old semivol usage not working so
              well. Should consider getting rid of OM25_p.

              Also more dtxt, changed 'index' to 'ind' (index is a fortran
              function, so good to avoid).

              Thus, PM results CHANGE (not drastically though)

              (Could do with a little more testing.)

SOA_mod.f90 - added Reset_3dOrganic to harmonise OM25_p and SURF_ugPM_OM25
              before Derived outouts are calculated.
              Also tidy up and more dtxt

Units_mod.f90 - some dtxt added

Removed ZD_OZONE/My_Ouputs
Content moved to Sites_mod and Config_module.f90
Sondes and sites species can be defined in config_emep.nml
(see example)
It should be compatible with different Chemical schemes in the sense
that unexisting species are accepted, but not outputted.
All the "extras" are still hardcoded in Config_module.
It was heavy to refactorize, because arrays are "merged" and everything was
hardcoded.
It would be good to simplify the multitude of arrays
(SITE_SHL,SITE_ADV, XTRA_SITE_MISC, XTRA_SITE_D2D, etc..)
Also merge with normal outputs would simplify (could simply have a new flag in our output).

CellMet_mod - adding dtxt and tidy-up

Debug_mod - made DEBUG%SUBMET as integer, allowing eg dbg for iL==2

22 May 2019, Dave

Config_module:

   - moved ExtraConfig replacements (key2str) later in Config, so that
      DataDir is set correctly. (See EEEEEE bits)
   - added LAST_CONFIG_LINE - a variable which can be added to the end of
      configs (or actually anywhere), to allow the user to check that
      the full config was actually read.
      (Very useful if also debugging use of ExtraConfig)
   - added associate_File usage for NEST_MET_inner, to allow DataDir

PhyChem_mod - added units to PAR

My_Outputs_mod: added use of find_duplicates
                started correction of met outputs (Bosco-inspired)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

DO3SE_mod          - added BUGGY to highlight current bug.
                     *** FIX before release (->rv4.33)
                     plus tidy up

DryDep_mod         - tidy up

GridValues_mod     - added fname to error message (it helps!)

LocalVariables_mod - added units to PAR

Rsurface_mod       - tidy up

Sites_mod          - tidy up and init of site_gindex, sonde_gindex
                     PLUS - added comma in asci output between date and hh
                     (more libreoffice calc friendly)

SmallUtils_mod     - added find_duplicates routine

Solver_mod         - tidy up

Nest options have changed. The "OUTDATE_NDUMP" is now decoupled from the "MODE"
options and both can be used simultaneously.

The "NEST_outdate" option (dump at given dates) is now chosen by:
1) Setting NEST_OUTDATE_NDUMP to the number of dates wanted (max 4).
2) Setting the firsts NEST_outdate accordingly
For example:
  NEST_OUTDATE_NDUMP = 2,          ! dump (save) 2 dates (max 4)
  NEST_outdate(1)= 2016,1,1,3,0    ! first date to save
  NEST_outdate(2)= 2016,1,1,7,0    ! second date to save

The filename for the dumps can be defined in NEST_template_dump.

New format emissions: automatic GNFR/SNAP sectors mapping.
SNAP is default. If sectors in an emission file are defined as GNFR (values

Nest stops if Met_inner not found (was only a warning before)

uEMEP: local fraction "completeness" diagnostic. Outputs a value for each
gridcell that sums all the local fractions. 1.0-> all sources have been found.

new format emissions: accept unit kt (and kt/year, kt/m2, kt/m2/year/).
and corrected bug when units where mg/s or mg/m2/s (were factor 1000 too small)

number of vertical levels in meteo file are checked each time a new meteofile
is read. If it has changed (happens in CAMS?), the vertical interpolations coefficients are recalculated.
Maybe a bug when not starting the run at hour=0 corrected (nrec was set to 1 at first call in meteoread)

Renamed ModelConstants_config -> Model_config

Merged nest and external_bic config into ModelConstants_config.
Most nest config variables renamed with a "NEST_" in front of variable.
Some cleaning for consistency.
Did *not* merge ExternalBICs_bc config

Also OutputConcs_config, OutputDep_config and OutputSize_config are now
part of  Model_config

Removed OutputMisc_config from config_emep.nml, as I could not see it was used.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6 May 2019, Peter

Merged Columns and ForestFire config namelists into ModelConstants_config
NB: some BB variables have changed name:
MODE->BBMODE
need_file->BBneed_file
need_date->BBneed_date
need_poll->BBneed_poll
verbose->BBverbose

Allow to include additonal namelist files. Example:
ExtraConfigFile(1)='OwnInputDir/MySpecialConfig.nml',
ExtraConfigFile(2)='OwnInputDir/MyVerySpecialConfig.nml',

The definition of the last namelist is used if variables are set several times.

Also replaced k20 with kmax in config, since we do not necessarily use 20
levels.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3 May 2019, Peter

Merged INPUT_PARA and Machine_config namelists into ModelConstants_config

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2 May 2019, Peter

Topography is read from HGT in case WRF meteo. It will automatically redefine
Topofile (cannot be defined from config then!)
Also more robust GetCDF_modelgrid when dimensions are incompatible (will now
stop only if the file is "needed")

The emis_inputlist%PollName functionality was broken (since May 2018?). Repaired.

USES%AOD removed. Instead AOD_WANTED is set to true if any AOD or EXT variable
are requested in outputs

Landuse files, fileName_O3_Top and fileName_CH4_ibcs are now set in the general
config file treatments (i.e. DataDir and OwnInputDir are replaced).

Met_inner for nesting tries to replace datadir and dates if not found
(but not GRID, as it should be another grid usually) (not tested)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
1 May 2019, Peter

Small bug in interpolation from Polar stereo to Polar stereo.
In the case when all these conditions are met:
1) interpolation from Polar stereo to Polar stereo
2) Conservative or mass conservative
3) Resolution of in grid is at coarser than met resolution/3

There is a small shift in the diagonal direction (1/3 gridcell).
This does not affect landuse PS to EECCA (exception 3))

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Added dry deposition parameters for MPAN

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
18 Apr 2019, Peter

mapping factor not allowed to be 0.0 at poles (lon lat only). (wrf problems otherwise).

DryDep: added a "if(dbg)" for  'DBGXNO2 WRONG' . Please check: is this just a
warning or not allowed? (it is triggered when USES%EURO_SOILNOX=F and USES%GLOBAL_SOILNOx=F).
Note also that the "first_ddep" never gets .false. (it is not saved).

Put -O2 for intel optimization: test show that it is not slower and faster to compile.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16 Apr 2019, Robert

* Added ZCM_EmChem16z directory -- for updated chemistry scheme

Reduced size of arrays that can be used for new format emissions.
Because the entire arrays are outputted into RunLog.out, even if not used.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15 Apr 2019, Peter

Replaced nstep by step_main. It is slightly different, now it always increase.
The results can be slightly different, because mod(nstep,2) which is used to alternate
in the timesplitting, is not alternating every nmax, if nmax is odd.
(Now it does always alternating).
You choose nmax by setting dt_advec in config. For example dt_advec=900.0 will
give nmax=12 and identical results.

Reduced the writings of 'dividing each gridcell...' and some new emission comments.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15 Apr 2019, Dave

Small problem-fixes:

** INTERIM COMMITS  ** OF ATTEMPTS TO cope with HK emissions
                       labelled often with !DSHK

Made start to allow lonlat femis to be applied outside, rather than inside box

Config_module - moved EmisSplit_OUT to config namelist (default false)

Debug_mod - changed DEBUG_EMISSIONS TO DEBUG%EMISSIONS (easier when debugging)

EmisDef_mod -  added 12th TEST sector while testing HK
               added logical femis_lonlat_internal - true if femis for inside domain

EmisGet_mod -  uses femis_lonlat_internal flag for in or out exclusion
               "xlonlat" in femis signals exclusion from outside lonlat domain
               comments (#) now allowed in femis data section
               use PrintLog and MasterProc instead of IO_LOG and me==0

Emissions_mod - uses DEBUG%EMISSIONS, and extra debug changes

ForestFire is now a "normal" module: it does not need to be specially integrated
in the genchem and compilation process. One can switch between GFAS and FINN using
BBMAP in the config file. The existence of the relevant species are tested before
they are used and only the one existing are included.

The module can still be defined with something like "if(OM25_ix>0)then..."
for other types of chemical schemes. But it will always compile and use the
species available from the default chemistry.

NBB_DEFS and NEMEPSPECS are set automatically.

Time for CMAQ emissions improved, 3D emissions new format started (read but not yet used).
Species cases:
1) emitted species (nox,sox,pm25 ...) with sector (1...11)
2) individual species (SO2, NO, NO2, ...) with sector. The species MUST be one of the splitted species.
3) individual species (SO2, APINENE, O3 ...) without sector (<=0, or not specified)
   In this case the emissions are summed up in setup_rcemis (not in EmisSet)

Can inject into individual levels (only case 3), individual species without sector)

e_fact (femis) is applied through the source%factor in Emis_init_GetCdf

New format for FMI ship emissions included in config_emep.nml.
All attributes can specified and overwritten by the config (see example for EC).
NB: this has different definitions, as the old method corrected REMPPM25 and
POM_f_FFUEL for molecular weights, but should not (emissions in kg, not moles. to be confirmed by Jan Eiof?)

Note on units "as SO2":
if the sector is defined, units are defined "as SO2" and SO4 must include the
factor 0.6666 to be right. If sector is defined as zero, no factor is required.

METSTEP settable in config
Softcoded mw for roaddust

Interim changes to get stuff into dev

MetFields_mod
Met_mod
   in testing - enabled NWP Hmix, for now with GLOBAL05 variable 'blh'.

Config_module
   in testing - added OwnInputDir

Nov 2018, Peter

On going... new format for emissions.
The goal is to be able to read any emission file, without having to modify it,
simply by describing the main parameters in the config file.

General structure as follows:
One 2D (or 3D) array for each "source".
One set of metadata for each file and each source (type(EmisFile_id_type) and type(Emis_id_type))

subroutine Init_Emissions and Emis_init_GetCdf read and set all metadata parameters (only once)
subroutine EmisUpdate update the 2D emission sources arrays when the data is outdated
in the (old) subroutine EmisSet the emissions are integrated into the final gridrcemis array

Metadata covers so far:
Filename, variable name.
Projection: 'lon lat' or not
Periodicity: hourly, monthly, yearly...
Grid resolution
Multiplicative factors for emissions: femis, or global attribute or variable attribute
Species (can be a emissions species that is splitted, or any single species)
Sectors
Country
Units
Flag to include this emission into the uEMEP local fractions.
Internal variables, such as number of sources, source indices, country indices etc.

Not yet implemented: timefactors, multicountry grids.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
31st Oct 2018, Peter

New format for emissions. For now it will work side by side with the old format,
and hopefully gradually take over.
Should work exactly as before for old emissions only.

Also some other small changes:
GLOBAL_SOILNOX set automatically true if global grid.
Moved assign_nmax after metstep defined (bug, but nmax is almost not used anyway).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
26th Oct 2018, Dave, (Peter)

YieldModifications set to 'VBS-T10' in config_emep.nml, config_EMEPSTD.nml
and config_EMEPGLOB.nml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15th Oct 2018, Peter, Dave

Bug in surface_precip (not "pr" the 3D precipitations).
The value was set 3600*METSTEP (= 10800 usually) times too small.
Like that since December 2013.

surface_precip is used as threshold in CellMet_mod.f90 and DustProd_mod.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14th Sep 2018, Robert

YieldModifications_mod:

Added Benzene and Toluene as SOA-precursors.
Added RO2+RO2-reactions as part of the low-NOx-path to SOA.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th Sep 2018, Robert, John, Dave

GasParticleCoeffs_mod:

BUG fix for problem triggered by 4th Sep version. The bug (using len(defnames)
instead of size(defnames) has been around for months.

Some problems caught by gfortran:
  My_Derived - removed NEMIS_FILE from use EmisDef_mod. Is in CM_ChemDims_mod

  Setup_1d_mod:
    write(*,"(a,i)") dtxt//'CHECK:iPMNEG:',ipm
    -> write(*,"(a,i0)") dtxt//'CHECK:iPMNEG:',ipm

  Makefile..SRCS
    removed FUTURE_isocom.o FUTURE_ISOFWD.o FUTURE_isorev.o

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5th Sep 2018, Dave

femis for AIRCRAFT added:

Country_mod:    used 900 for AIRCRAFT
Emissions_mod:  uses e_fact to modify NOX emissions (only nox possible)
Setup_1d_mod:   extra debug printout
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4th Sep 2018, Robert
Added some more deposition classes for dry and wet deposition -- mainly for
EmChem18 but also for updated versions of EmChem16x.

GasParticleCoeffs_mod.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd Sep 2018, Dave
rv4.31 tag added
since Robert will soon make changes that affect results
rv4.31 can be associated with the (untested) NWP Hmix possibility

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd Sep 2018, Peter

Big bug when femis and non-fraction emissions are used (introduced 22 May 2018).


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
1st Sep 2018, Dave

Aqueous - removed lots of A2018 comment lines

ColumnSource  - added CheckStop for size of PROC_LOC (failed a DEBUG=yes test for global run)
       NEEDS check. Why doesn't -1 for NMAX_LOC work as suggested in config_emep?
       And ... please don't use l as a variable. Looks too much like 1 sometimes. This is one of our
       few 'programming rules' ;-)

Debug_module   - moved GETEMIS and ROADDUST to DEBUG% system
EmisGet_mod    - moved GETEMIS and ROADDUST to DEBUG% system. Also some formatting to get < 78 char lines
Emissions_mod  - moved GETEMIS and ROADDUST to DEBUG% system. Also some formatting to get < 78 char lines

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
28 Aug 2018, Dave, based upon Matthieu, Peter code

Incomplete introduction of NWP as an option for Hmix
Not tested yet since PBLH isn't in EECCA or EMEP01 standard data.

 BLPhysics_mod
     HmixMethod moved to PBL%

 Config_module - moved HmixMethod
 Debug_module  - DEBUG_MET becomes DEBUG%MET

 MetFields_mod.f90
    - added use of pbl_nwp. Set as needed if PBL%HmixMethod set at NWP

 Met_mod.f90
    - NWP option uses pbl_nwp
    - Also some tidy-ups (lines should be less than 78 chars wide)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27 Aug 2018, Robert

Added deposition parameters for some semi-volatile VBS-species (extending the
"Wesely Table") in GasParticleCoeffs_mod.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27 Aug 2018, Peter

Bug in wrf metdata for Lambert projection, when TRUELAT1 = TRUELAT2
Allow several meteo records within one METSTEP (when metdata has timestep less than one hour)
Only superficially tested, and only wrf.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27 Aug 2018, Dave

RE-TAGGING as rv4.30 (since there were problems with the attempt to re-name
as rv4.20)

Radiation_mod.f90 - just cleaned up units explanation

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
22 Aug 2018, Dave

TAGGING as rv4.20.

This code differs mainly from rv4.17 as used in R2018 by using the new
ecosx-based chemistry and YieldModifications, as detailed below.
(Peter had used rv4.18, 19 for internal work.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15 Aug 2018, Dave

NEW FILE: Debug_module - with variables moved from Config_module. This helps
  compatability with ESX, and should also allow more space to add comments
  concerning these debug variables.

=> many changes in .f90 files

SOA_mod.f90
Solver_mod.f90
YieldModifications_mod.f90

  - modified yield modifications code and usage


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7th Aug 2018, Dave

ZCM_EmChem16x/emissplt_run
  Replaced  defaults.nox with new version containing SHIPNOx
  Added specials files for all POLL

On vilje, stallo, elvis:
  ~mifapw/Data/ZCM_EmChem16x/emissplit_run:
    Copied all files from above here. Used as default by Config_module.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5th Aug 2018, Dave

ZCM_EmChem16x
BiomassBurningMapping_FINNv1.5_to_EmChem16x.inc - added back PM
CM_* files: Added new style Yield Modification equations to match rv4.17master


Small changes:

Config_module - DEBUG%SOA now integer

Setup_1d__mod.f90 - just removed some printout
SOA_mod.f90 - corrected use of DEBUG%SOA
YieldModifications_mod  - using integer DEBUG%SOA

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20th  July 2018, Peter

ReadField_CDF: Return zero (or Undef) when file or field not found and not needed
(returned unchanged array before)

ForestFire: replaced allocatable array rdemis and xrdemis by automatic arrays
(this is more efficient memorywise). Also set xrdemis to zero (was not done but
possibly is done automatically when the array is allocated).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7th  July 2018, Dave

ZCM_EmChem16x files: removed BIOTERP as species, and changed ordering of species

Biogenic_mod.f90 - more use of dtxt and corrected case in Ash

Derived_mod.f90 - changed sub to dtxt for easier greps

My_Derived_mod.f90 - added BioNatC5H8 and BioNatTERP. CRUDE and confusing with
  also code in Derived_mod.f90. FIX LATER.

config_EMEPSTD.nml - added GLOBAL/EURO settings comments and DEBUG%STOFLUX
                    (not needed, just as reminder while testing.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th  July 2018, Peter

Change chunk size of 2D output to 300 ,130 (i,j) to speed up the verification
script (recommended by Heiko)

Changed the test for GLOBAL_setting with minlat=19 instead of 28 (EECCA was set
as global!) and East limit to -40

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th  July 2018, Dave

Aqueous_mod: found error (k=0) when using DEBUG. Fixed by setting kcloudtop
  to -999 in the "cirrus" cases that were not caught, and using RETURN in
  WetDeposition call if kcloudtop < 1. Results for WDEP_specs identical,
  but WDEP_PREC has tiny difference. Not understood, but the old code did
  allow array overrun in e.g. dA(k).

Biogenics_mod.f90: Use DEBUG%SOILNOX

Config_module.f90: Use DEBUG%SOILNOX

Emissions_mod.f90: Use DEBUG%SOILNOX, plus some extra writes (debugging)

GridValues_mod.f90 : just another write statement whie checking GLOBAL_settings etc.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4th  July 2018, Peter

Changed default path of EmisHeights.txt

work/Data/EmisHeights.txt -> EmisHeights_Rep17.txt

Gave different files for Stallo/Elvis and Vilje! (Vilje will be unchanged now, sector 10 was different)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd  July 2018, Dave

BUG FIXES

Setup_1d_mod.
  Check for DDspec(ipm)%Gv > 0, not 1 !! Was big bug!!
  Smaller debug formatting changes
  use size(rcphot,dim=1) instead of just size(rcphot) (only when debugging)

DefPhotolysis_mod
   Comment out HCOHCO options. (bug related to BoxChem compatability)

ZCM_EmChem16x
   Corrected various rates, including HCOHCO

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD
   Corrected numbering for rcAeroN2O5 and now rc98HO2

CLEANUP:
   Removed most of A2018files. Shouldn't be needed now. Some files left while checking

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
22nd June 2018, Peter

Removed sdot from code (was not in use). Only Etadot is used.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19th June 2018, Peter

Small bugs in landuse (affect performance only)
old_month was not reset -> recalculate pftmaps each iteration
my_first_call was not saved -> may allocate an allocatable array.

18th June 2018, Peter, Svetlana

Made the file   DataDir/CLIM/EMEP_BC.nc

8th June 2018, Peter

Automatic global settings in subroutine set_EuropeanAndGlobal_Config
(GridValues_mod.f90)
The code will find out by itself if the rundomain is global (meaning not only
Europe is covered) or not

  !If the file is GLOBAL:
  !1) USES%PFT_MAPS = .true. (can be overridden by FORCE_PFT_MAPS_FALSE)
  !2) USES%DEGREEDAY_FACTORS = .false.
  !3) USES%EURO_SOILNOX = .false.
  !
  !If the file is EUROPEAN:
  !nothing happens for now

Degreeday file is not required to exist for wrf users, for others, by default
it is required for non-global runs (code will stop if not found).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7tn June 2018, Alvaro

Fix USES%AOD=T.

ZCM_EmChem16x/CM_ChemGroups_mod:
  Some of the elements in EXTINC_GROUP_MAPBACK were misnamed

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th June 2018,  Peter

Can now start and end run at any hour (must be one that is available in the metdata)

The method to setup the meteo reading is much modified, so it might be that
some new meteo format will not fit (will stop the code).
METSTEP is now set in Check_Meteo_Date_Type (was set in GetFullDomainSize)
The method relies on the ReadTimeCDF routine to be able to interpret times in
the meteo file.
All meteo files are assumed to have the same number of records (this could
probably be upgraded if needed)

Spinup period:
in OutputSize_config you can set spinup_enddate. If this is after startdate
The averaging and outputting of data is not started before spinup_enddate is
reached. Not thoroughly tested.
Note: it should be allowed to start a run in Decembre for spinup, but that
will not work for now, because Emission time factors, leapyear and perhaps
other things are set only once at the start of the run, and not updated when a
new year is reached.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4th June 2018,  Peter

Monthly save for nest allowed.

Changed many names from upper to mixed case to match new EmChem16x,
eg DUST to Dust, SEASALT to SeaSalt, -F to _f.

ZCM_EmChem16x/BoundaryConditions_EmChem16x - added back DUST_SAH

Config_module.f90 - changed default DustFile to Dust2014_month.nc

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
22-24 May 2018, Peter

Big refactoring of emission inputting.
EmisGetCDF is now more general, and is used both for "fraction" or "country" style
sector emissions. Works also with monthly emissions.
A new format is allowed, which is an extension of the "country" style format.
The emissions can have names with format
Emis:FR:snap:7:spec:sox:fac:1.0
where the name after "spec:" specifies the species, and the number after
"fac:" gives a scaling factor

A completely new (internal) format for emissions is introduced.
Will be generalized in the future.
In the new format, a new emission is read into Emis_field(i,j,n) where n defines the identity of the field.
the structure "Emis_id" will then identify for each id the actions to be taken (splits, time factors, emission heights etc.)
It is a kind of generalized sector, and sectors emissions will be attempted put there in the future.
For now it can already handle the "SpecialShips" from FMI if the names are redefined (updated file defined in config_emep.nml).
There was a difficulty with old setup, since the FMIship emissions do not use our standard emitted species and splits.
The new format can use emissions for any species in CM_ChemSpec.

"flat" emissions removed. (were not even used anymore!)

There was also a bug in the SecEmisOut maps (output): the map namess did not match the
species (introduced 30 April 2018)

And a bug for ship emissions: NTime_Read was not reinitialized. As a consequence "special
 ship emissions" may not be used in some cases. If DMS is just before in the emis_inputlist,
 as is default, it will work fine.

NB: the ship used special molecular weights, therefore, the factors are not integers
      !mw from Jukka-Pekka  Jalkanen  (e-post 16 June 2016)
      mw=46.0 for NOx
      mw=28.0 for CO
      mw=64.0655 for SOx which is only SO2
      mw=96.0655 for SO4
      mw=42.4 for Ash
      mw=12.01 for EC
      mw=17.32 for OC
! Comments from Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen at FMI

!   The composition of Ash can be taken from Jana’s paper
!   (Moldanova et al, Atm Env 43 (2009) 2632-2641), Table 8. According to
!   that, the composition by weight is: C (11.1%), O (5.7%), S (4.9%),
!   V (30.7%), Ni (20.9%), Ca (26.7%). This composition was determined for
!   fuel with 1.9% sulphur and it will not be directly applicable to fuels
!   used in the Baltic Sea during 2015. However, that is the only reference
!   I could find which reports the elemental composition of Ash.

! All primary PM emitted should be assigned to PM2.5 fraction since the PM
! size of fresh exhaust is less than 100 nm. Whether this grows fast enough
! to >2.5 microns in the timescale used by the regional models is not known
! to me at this point.

 chem params closer to R2017.

Deposition changes:
  GasParticleCoeffs_mod - revised to R2017 values!
                          BIG effects on NO2!
Surface area changes:

  AeroConstants_mod  - revised AERO constants
  ChemFields_mod     - use NSAREA_DEF not AERO%NSAREA
  Setup_1d_mod       - bug fixes on SurfArea

SeaSalt/Dust emissions fixed:
  (upper case tests weren't matching new mixed case names)
  SmallUtils_mod     - added any_case option to find_index_c
  SeaSalt_mod        - added any_case usage to find_index_c and StopAll
  DustProd_mod       - added any_case usage to find_index_c

Also needing any_case, since GenChem doesn't upper-case species names now:

  Derived_mod       - added any_case usage
  My_Derived_mod    - added any_case usage


ZCM_EmChem16x files
  - fixes for N2O5 dep, Extinc seetings, FINEEC for FFIRE_BC, etc.
  - DustExtended from chem used
  - MW corrected for dust

SMALLER CHANGES:
  Aero_Vds_mod    - use DEBUG%VDS not DEBUG_VDS

9th May 2018, Peter

Moved uEMEP diffusion into uEMEP_mod.f90 and more optimization.
Now vertical advection is done only up to 2 layers above uEMEP%Nvert
Since all local fraction are zero above uEMEP%Nvert, this gives almost the same
result. Less than 0.001 differences in locfrac, except sometimes over sea, because
ship emission are higher up and need to come down to diminish locfrac
Also bug fix, that could make localfractions nan at the northern boundary.

Fix USES%AOD=T.

Deriver_mod:

To output local fraction corrected groups or primary components, set the subclass
as 'Local_Correct', in config, for instance:
      'NO'       ,'ppb' ,'Local_Correct','AIR_CONCS','SPEC' ,'YMH',
      'PPM25'    ,'ug'  ,'Local_Correct','AIR_CONCS','GROUP','YMH',

(note that not all 'Local_Correct' will make sense, since they will take local
correction for all parts. PMFINE, for instance will also correct the SIA, using
PPM local fractions.)

21 April 2018, Dave

BUG FIXES, MAJOR
  1. Photolysis - was zero
  2. Aerosols - calculation of ugSIA was wrong

rcphot - was zero!
  now defined in ZchemData_mod, and allocated in ChemFields
  Need to allocate with NRCPHOTextended!
  Affects DefPhotolysis, FastJ_mod, Solver

DefPhotolysis
  HONO rate added at 0.22* NO2 rate (uses NRCTPHOTextended dimension)

Setup_1d_mod
  Added is_sia and is_sia_a and made it work ;-)
  Fixed wrong use of ugPMF
  Added checkValidArray checks on rct and rcphot (when DEBUG%SETUP_1d on)

ChemFields
  Allocate rcphot with NRCPHOTextended!


NEW ROUTINES

  CheckStop_mod: checkValidArray to check eg all rct
  SmallUtils_mod: num2str for simple conversions

FUTURE -need to check/implement HONO and NRCTPHOTextented in FastJ

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20 April 2018, Peter

All "very important messages" at head of Log.changes removed, as most of them where
outdated, and just make people think that nothing is valid.

Updated link to emissplit in Config_module.f90. Can be overridden by config

Added a format in StopAll message, so that path do not get cut.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20 April 2018, Dave

mk.ChemFiles: NEW - to collect CM files from ZCM_ directories

New split files (EmChem16x) added into DataDir/inputs_emepdefaults_Apr2018
and config files (config_A2018.nml for run.pl, config_emep.nml for
stallo sbatch).

Added "IMPORTANT NOTE" for A2018 stuff above

MOVED:
GenChem.pl to ZCM_OLD  - not used now
mk.GenCheml to ZCM_OLD - not used now

ZCM_EmChem16x
 - added CM files
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19 April 2018, Dave

ZCM_OLD - new directory.
          All pre-A2018 ZCM directories moved here.
          Cannot be used with new system

Aero2017nx reactions added to ZCM_EmChem16x

AeroConstants_mod: NEW - to store AERO and NSAREA_DEF and avoid
  circularity

Radiation_mod: needed to declare real hour

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
17-18 April 2018, Alvaro

Radiation_mod:
  Fix error on sunrise/sunset caused. The hourangle returned radians instad
  of degrees. This functions are, so far, only used on the development
  of Pollen emissions (FORECAST mode).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
17 April 2018, Dave


AeroFunctions_mod

   *BUG* found in old code. SS2 and SS3 were mixed up for Gerber calculations

Config_module - changes in AERO

Derived_mod - changed DpgV to umDpgV

GasParticleCoeffs_mod
    Re-coded AERO stuff - still confusing, but a bit less so I hope.
    DpgV changed to umDpgV in DDdefs
    Added Gb to DDspec
    More changes to come.

Setup_1d_mod.f90
    Re-coded aerosol surface area - still confusing, but a bit less so I hope.
    More changes to come

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16 April 2018, Dave

SOA_ml - recoded for new system
Runchem_ml - added first_tstep argmument to Init_OrganicAerosol call

run.pl - new temporary SplitDefaultsFile location (hard-coded on stallo)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15 April 2018, Dave

A2018 INTERIM changes continue...

Biogenics_mod - now use 'NATBIO' type, so we have NATBIO%C5H8 etc. This can
  be used from CM_Reactions1. The advantage is that one can write terms such
  as:

      rcbio(NATBIO%TERP) = 0.45 APINENE + 0.20 LIMONENE + 0.35 TESTBVOC ;

  in GenIn_Reactions.txt. The disadvantage is that this term won't appear
  as emissions in the mass budget of eg APINENE. Needs more thought....

  BUG in OLD code? Didn't find rcemis for SOILNO in GLOBAL case. Maybe
   elsewhere? Added StopAll until this is resolved.

ChemFields_mod - needed hard-coded size 4 for rcbio. Needed to avoid circularity with
  NetCDF - Biogenics.  Will re-code soon, likely with new module for non-CDF
  NatBioFunctions_mod.

Config_module - removed BVOC stuff, except new NATBIO

Emissions_mod - removed unused NBVOC

LandPFT_mod - removed need of BVOC_USED

SOA_mod    - just renamed OM25_P to _p. The new GenChem preserves case

Solver_mod - added NATBIO access

My_Derived - removed use of BVOC_GROUP. NEED to recode!

ZD_ESX/My_ESX_ml.f90 removed. Obsolete

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
08-09 Apr 2018, Dave

Unimod no more :-)

emepctm is the executable

emep_Main is the name of the main :-)

(end of poetry section.)


MANY MANY CHANGES! INTERIM VERSION!
(Changes usually marked with A2018 for April 2018)

SORRY,.....
     but once this is done EMEP, ESX and BoxChem will all work from the
 same system, with the immediate benefit that Robert  can test chemistry
 in the box and emep models at the same time. The new GenChem fixes some
 bugs with the old in any case. The complex mapping of wet and dry deposition
 have also been simplified.

WARNING: some code is simply commented out since I didn't have time
  to fix all, and some help from others would be useful.

WARNING: Do not use the old GenChem system now! We need to get the new one
 in place - speak to Dave

 THEREFORE: CM_ files in current directory are *only* scheme to use just now
  Will change soon!

  Also, the Makefile no longer attempts to run GenChem. We will do this
 separately in future.

WARNING: Aerosol stuff *has* bugs, especially
  the link to surface area which is/was confusing.

WARNING: Extinc stuff is currently commented out, but will be brought
  in via the new GenChem, as part of the GenIn_Species file.


GasParticleCoeffs_now now takes care of the CM_DryDep.inc and
CM_WetDep.inc stuff, now mapping to a simpler set of arrays and avoiding
different indices for gases and particles. Definitions of scav rates,
particle size and density are all now done in this module.


Now have CM_ChemDims for eg NSPEC_TOT, NEMIS_File, etc.


EmisDef_mod and Emissions_mod.
  Added 'private' to EmisDef_mod
  which needed a lot of 'public' on various variables used by Emissions_mod


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9 April 2018, Peter

Small bug in "day of the week": the local hour West  UTC was always positive,
giving possible wrong day of the week a few hours each day.

Introduction of "automatic mask" for emissions. In config set for instance:
emis_inputlist(1)%set_mask = T,
emis_inputlist(2)%use_mask = T,
NB: the order of the masks do matter and Yealy emissions are always treated before monthly (i.e. you cannot make a mask from monthly and apply it to yearly)
The mask will be defined *only* at positions with some emissions (larger than 1.E-20)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27 Mar 2018, Dave

Small renames, on way to EMEP/ESX merge

mv ChemFunctions_ml.f90 ChemFunctions_ml.f90
mv Setup1dfields_ml.f90 ZchemData_mod.f90

GasParticleCoeffs_ml to GasParticleCoeffs_mod

Changed references in most files.

Also Makefile.SRCS, GenChem.pl

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
26 Mar 2018, Dave

NetCDF_ml : small debug changes - added dtxt and dtxt_smg

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
09 Mar 2018, Peter, Massimo

When the input data has at least 10 times coarser resolution than teh metdata
and both are in latlon, there can be an interpolation bug that give zero.
Shows clearly as vertical lines.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
08 Mar 2018, Peter

Allow separate files for hourly outputs. Use the config keyword, for example:
  HOURLYFILE_ending	= 'JJJ.nc',
(note that compared to earlier versions, "hour" is always added by the model,
 and should not be part of the keyword)

removed the deprecated Output_hourly.f90 (excellent to be able to clean something!)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
07 Mar 2018, Peter

Upgrade of "emis_inputlist". Can now mix monthly and yearly emission sets.
Also "country style" emissions can now be monthly (although not tested).
NB: the monthly time factors are reset to 1 if monthly emissions are used
(in order not to count them twice). Will change results
If both monthly and yearly emissions are used, the monthly emissions will first
be divided by the monthly factor before merging to yearly.
renamed "snapemis" to "secemis", as we do not only have snap sector categories.
Perhaps not fully tested, as there are plenty of combinations possible.

Also set NITERXMAX=40 in Advection_ml
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
06 Mar Dave, Heiko

Ecosystem_ml
My_Derived_ml
config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml

  - added is_forest and Forest outputs - merges both conif and decid
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
02 Mar 2018, Heiko

Showing namelist-error line, gfortran fixes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
26th Feb 2018, Alvaro

Open Source 201802, rv4_17

DefPhotolysis_ml
  Fix USET query when no 3D output is required

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14th Feb 2018, Dave

ZCM_EmChem16mt and all EmChem16mt files renamed to EmChem16a

Also in mk.GenChem, run.pl and Makefile.

EmChem16abase-reactions: bug-fixes for HONO and OD+H2O rates

NEW: LandInputs_Feb2018

   glc2000xCLMf18.nc i
   csv files same as Apr2017

config_EMEPGLOB.nml
   uses new landcover
   added PANDA emissions as possible (better?!) emissions for global

config_EMEPSTD.nml
   uses new landcover
   has MonthlyNH3='LOTOS' - intended for EECCA/Europe only!

ChemFunctions_ml
   Merged SmixC into Smix. Just use Smix, but this now has coarse aerosol too.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
13-14th Feb 2018, Peter

Removed the two 2d and one 3d "specials" for uEMEP outputs, and replace them
by "USET" outputs (example in config_emep.pl and config_Outputs_NORWAY.nml
Redefined slightly is_water is_ice and is_allsea; several water or ice categories
can in principle be defined.
For 3d output, also subclass can start by 'D3', instead of name (to allow more
freedom in names as they appearin the output).

New config flag HourlyEmisOut = .false., to output snap and sector emissions hourly
This is set automatically if uEMEP hourly output are requested.

In effect removed the changes introduced 5th Feb 2018

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9th Feb 2018, Svetlana

LandType(n)%is_desert is implemented in LandDefs_ml and DustProd_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9th Feb 2018, Peter

Snowdepth multiplied by 5 by default (not for WRF metdata). This is because
IFS snowdepth is given in water equivalent, while the model needs meters of
snow.
Added SplitSpecialsFile and BiDirInputFile under NAMELIST /ModelConstants_config/
(were missing)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
8th Feb 2018, Dave

Config_module
Timefactors_ml
  - added USES%MonthlyNH3, with a LOTOS option. Gives better NH3 :-)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7th Feb 2018, Dave

NEW BUT EMPTY:  BiDir_module.f90, BiDir_emep.f90
  - added so that Roy and Dave can work with the BiDir version.
  - Makefile.SRCS modified

BiDir -associated changes in :

  Biogenics_ml.f90
   - commented out old enh3 code. Some safety initialisations added.

  CellMet_ml.f90
   - added is_frozen, sets Grid%latitude rh2m
  DryDep_ml.f90
   - also clean up and some BIDIR entries
  LocalVariables_ml.f90
   - removed GasParticleCoeffs_ml dependency with NLOCDRYDEP_MAX param
   - added sst

  My_Derived_ml
   - added Emis_mgm2_BioNatSoilNH3

  Unimod.f90
   - added call to Init_BiDir

ZCM_EmChem16mt/
  Added Aero2017nx.reactions - excludes some (R18) gas-aerosol uptake
        Aero2017nx.species
  EmChem16mtbase.reactions - added rcbio for NH3

mk.GenChem - uses above Aero2017nx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th Feb 2018, Dave

config_EMEPSTD.nml
 - commented out GRID line in ColumnSource_config that was causing problems
 - added BIDIR and BiDir variables in preparation for future step

ColumnSource_ml.f90
 - added dtxt='ColSrcConf' to help debug outputs

NEW: UPDATE_README.md - start of text to explain rv4.17 update

Config_module.f90
  - clean-up - removed old USE_ variables


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5th Feb 2018, Matthieu, Alvaro, Peter

Special outputs for uEMEP. Only temporary.
Tee "specials" (special2d, special3d) should be put into USET, and the "H" in
Derived_ml must be revised.

Edit: these changes are removed 14th Feb

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
26th Jan 2018 Peter, John

Corrected bug in wrf met reading for snow. Was using SNOWNC which is accumulated since
the start of the run, while SNOWH should have been used.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19th Jan 2018 Peter

A specific sector category (SNAP or GNFR) can be forced in config for example:
USE_SECTORS_NAME = 'SNAP',

Even if the emissions are defined in GNFR, they will be mapped over to SNAP, so
that everything looks like SNAP was used. The concentrations should be identical,
because so far we haven't introduce any specific parametrization for GNFR.

Also removed the Emis_SOURCE and Emis_TEST flags, that were no more in use.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
21st Dec     2017 Dave  rv4_16

** TAGGING as rv4_16 **

Rsurface_ml: cleaned and simplified structure

ChemFunctions: bug fix for gamma SmixC   (changes results a bit with SmixC)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7th Dec      2017 Dave

** TAGGING as rv4_16beta **
Should be same as code used for N2O5 paper

Config_module - now includes previous emep_Config_mod.f90

rm emep_Config_mod.f90

Changes in :

  Biogenics_ml.f90 BLPhysics_ml.f90 Config_module.f90 Landuse_ml.f90 Met_ml.f90
  OutputChem_ml.f90 PhyChem_ml.f90 Runchem_ml.f90 Solver.f90 YieldModifications_mod.f90

6th Dec      2017 Dave

*** RESULTS CHANGING ***** START of rv4_16beta
** ModelConstants_ml renamed!

1) Science

N2O5:

  EmChem16mtbase.species now has deposition of N2O5 set to that of HNO3. This
  makes a big difference to N2O5 levels, and some difference to
  o3 etc.  Could have done the same for NO3 but that causes small changes.

FFIRE_CO:
  ZCM_EmChem16mt:

  BiomassBurning_FINNv1.5_to_EmChem16mt  - added FFIRE_CO

  ZCM_EmChem09:

  Added ForestTracers.species ForestTracers.reactions

  ForestFire_ml - modified to cope with FFIRE_CO

  config_emep.nml and config_Outputs_EMEPSTD now have FFIRE_CO as examples.

  mk.GenChem - uses ForestFire tracers for EmChem16mt


ModelConstants_ml now renamed to Config_module!

  - since the constants are now very variable and it was easier to rename this
    than to move code into emep_Config. In the next step the small emep_Confg
    stuff can move here, and maye we can even retsart ModelConstants for some
    constants ;-)

  - change 'use' calls in most files.

  NOTE: Changed also in ZD_Pollen, and ZD_3CVar, but not other ZD_Var directories.



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd Dec      2017 Michael G

Switched from USE_XXX to USES%XXX method for five variables:

*** RESULTS CHANGING ***** START of rv4_16beta

Implemented Weiss & Norman radiation scheme, to give better diffuse/direct
treatment. Changes in:

  Biogencs_ml - modified to use total PAR from W & N
  MetFields - added PARdbh, PARdif, fCloud
  Radiation_ml - add WeissNorman routines and usage
  Rsurface_ml  - add WeissNorman routines and usage
  PhyChem -  use of above

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
01st Dec     2017 Michael G

Switched from USE_XXX to USES%XXX method for nine variables:
USE_SOILWATER, USE_CONVECTION, USE_AIRCRAFT_EMIS, USE_LIGHTNING_EMIS,
USE_SEASALT, USE_DUST, USE_ROADDUST, USE_EURO_SOILNOX, USE_GLOBAL_SOILNOX

Files affected:

DustProd_ml.f90 EmisGet_ml.f90 Biogenics_ml.f90

This should not lead to any changes in the model results and this was
tested before git push.
Other USE_* variables will be changed in further updates soon.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
28th Nov     2017  Dave

ChemFunctions_ml
  Now allows any number in Gamma:xxxx for N2O5 hydrolysis (instead of SmixC
   etc). For example, with Gamma:0.02 we derive the numerical value, gFix=0.02,
   from this string

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27th Nov     2017  Dave

Country_ml
   Fixed --100 to -100 for HT1015   ! BUG!!
   More length to country name
   Extra tests in self_test

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23rd Nov     2017  Peter, Massimo

There was a bug when the lon lat grid is defined in such a way that the transition
from negative to positive longitudes is on the same processor.
This does never happen if the grid starts at -180, such as our GLOBAL or GLOBAL05 grids.
The model could then crash in the landuse (explains Massimo's issue).

Also changed the lib path in utils/uEMEP_GUI.py , so that it works on Stallo.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16th Nov     2017  Peter

GetEuroBVOC() uses hardcoded landuse (CF,DF...). If these where not defined
the index (ibvoc) gets negative, and values are written in a random part of memory.
This might be the reason why the code crash when glc2000.nc was defined for both
landuse files.
Added if(ibvoc<0)cycle which seems to solve this problem.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14-15th Nov     2017  Peter

All files (except config) can be linked through config.
Only Unimod and config_emep.nml are needed.
Just run from any directory; copy Unimod (executable) and config_emep.pl and:
mpirun Unimod
(you should of course do this from a compute-node or in a script)

config_emep.nml is now simply made from config_EMEPSTD.nml+config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml
and the first &INPUT_PARA Block
At present default path are set in ModelConstants_ml
ALL links removed from run.pl. We do not need it anymore?
Still to be done:
.-Emissplit now taken from DataDir/ZCM_EmChem16mt/EMISSPLIT/ . Should be adapted to chemistry in use
.-femis/SR runs?
.-general bash script?


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9th Nov     2017  Peter

Corrected bug in uEMEP/uemep_adv_k when uEMEP%Nvert = 1
(Otherwise no effect)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th Nov     2017  Peter

Some flexibilities for AROME meteorology:
Surface precipitations can be accumulated. Assumes it has name
'precipitation_amount_acc'and unit mm (or kg/m2).
Surface pressure can be either Pa or hPa (it looks at the value to find out).
Time dimension can be called "times" (but it is not recommended).
The code accept meteorology in either Short or Float (or Double) types.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
24th Oct     2017  Dave

Landuse_ml - BUG FIX for non Euro domains anyway
             Initialise landuse_tot
             Add where statement to check if landuse_tmp > 0

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19th Oct     2017  Dave

My_Derived_ml - just increased default size of MAX_NUM_NEWMOS to be 30, see #76.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19th Oct     2017  Peter

Country code column in the "lonlat" lines in femis.dat.
If the code is zero, all countries within the lonlat rectangle will be reduced;
otherwise only the country corresponding toi the code will be reduced.

There is backward compatibility, in the sense that it will work if the country code
is omitted, however this should be avoided: put 0 instead for reducing all countries.
The backward compatibility will not work if there are comments at the end of the line

Example of femis:
Name  7         sox        nox        co       voc     nh3     pm25   pmco
 28    0        1.0        1.0       1.0      1.0      1.0     1.0    1.0
lonlat 0.0 25.0 45.0 60.0  0 0    0.0  1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0
lonlat 0.0 25.0 45.0 60.0  17 0    1.0  0.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0
lonlat 0.0 25.0 45.0 60.0  3 0    1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   0.0   1.0   1.0

17th Oct     2017  Alvaro

ModelConstants_ml, Met_ml, ColumnSource_ml, ForestFire_ml, ZD_Pollen/Pollen_ml:
- Extend length of the meteo path/filename variable.
  From open source user feedback, see metno/emep-ctm#25.
- TXTLEN_FILE parameter defines path/filename length.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16th Oct     2017  Peter

Allow to switch off (i.e. not take into account) femis for specific emissions
files. Only the lines with "lonlat" format are switched off.
To switch off femis-lonlat for the emissions specified in emis_inputlist(1),
add this in config file:
emis_inputlist(1)%use_lonlat_femis = F,

uEMEP: output only lowest level (can be modified to different number of levels,
but hardcoded for now)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14th Oct     2017  Dave

run.pl - just added Peter's text concerning 16 or 32 threads, since this it

Radiation_ml:  identified problem with diffuse/direct !!! TO-FIX
               Added TSTEMX lines to illustrate this.

19-21th Sep  2017  Alvaro

ForestFire_ml:
- fix gFortran compile error

ModelConstants_ml
- Ash from historical Eruptions by default (#49,#29)

ColumnSource_ml:
- stop simulation when NMAX_LOC/NMAX_EMS is exceeded (#44)
- topography file (topo_nc) is required by default,
  can be made optional on ColumnSource_config namelist (need_topo=F) (#31)

ColumnSource_ml,run.pl,config_$exp_name.nml
- read NMAX_LOC/NMAX_EMS from ColumnSource_config namelist (#29)
- estimate NMAX_LOC/NMAX_EMS from lines on input files when NMAX_LOC/NMAX_EMS<1 (#29)

Derived_ml:
- fix bug afecting Z_MID output (#47)

ForestFire_ml,Nest_ml,Pollen_ml,run.pl,config_$exp_name.nml

NetCDF_ml:
- improve missing file error message

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
18th Sep  2017  Dave

ForestFire_ml.f90

   - added new option (MODE="MONTHLY_CLIM" or "C" or "c") to deal with
   climatological BB emissions, where the monthly averages have been
   pre-calculated. This might be from the year in question, but the main
   aim is to allow e.g. 10-year average climatologies to be used where
   'real' data is not available.

   (A preliminary 10-year data set from FINNv1.5 can be found in
    /global/work/mifads/FFIRE_TESTS/gRemapMonthly10yr.nc.  Also need to
    set ${'FINN'} in run.pl to use, along with modified MODE in
    config Fire_config. )

   - changed function newFFrecord to be subroutine, since (a) I don't
   like functions to do more than return one value (ie no side-effects),
   (b) most fortran style-suggestions don't like that either, and (c)
   having more than one contains command per module is also confusing
   (IMO!).

  - harmonised treatement of ReadField_CDF across different BB sources
  - Extra documentation
  - Modified debug, though this is still somewhat confusing

5th   Aug  2017  Dave
Bug-fix to restore IAM_VEG for whole domain. (rv4_15 only had IAM_VEG for the inner
area where landocover came from the Landuse_PS_5km_LC.nc file.

Solution now is to set IAM_VEG for all land-cover areas except those specified
in the config array FLUX_IGNORE:

  FLUX_IGNORE = 'W', 'D', 'DE', 'ICE', 'BARE'   ! Ignore these for FLUX calcs.

This allows for future landcover data-sets, which might have other codes for
these non-veg areas. (The 'IAM_VEG' currently found in Landuse_PS_5km_LC.nc
is now ignored.)

Changes:
Landuse_ml - as above
ModelCostants_ml - added FLUX_IGNORE
config_EMEPSTD.nml - added FLUX_IGNORE
config_EMEPGLOB.nml - added FLUX_IGNORE

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th  June 2017  Peter, Anna

Bug fix! timefactors can be wrong in certain cases.
If a timefactor code is defined several times in Country_ml, the timefactor for
the last one is used instead of the first one (using find_index).
This will normally give a default timefactor of 1. Affects:
shipping emissions (country codes 30-34, but does not matter, since the timefactors are 1 anyway?)
"European Community" (code 64, not used?), Turkey (code 25), "Rest of Russia " (Code 42).

Allow country specific hourly factor. The idea is that we define cities by a new
country code, and special traffic hourly factors are applied to those (CAMS50 project).
17 European cities are defined in Country_ml.f90.
The new factors are given for now at:
$DataDir/inputs_emepdefaults_Jun2017/HourlyFacsSpecials.CAMS50
As long as the emisions do not have these new City-codes, there will be no effect.
Defaults are the old values.

Allow a special format for ship emissions.
Implemented in a rush for reporting. Should be cleaned/revised.
Monthly only for now.

Example of format:
!  emis_inputlist(3)%name = '/home/mifajej/Emissions/Ships/FMI_Glob/2015/FMIGlobShip2015mon.nc',  !
!  emis_inputlist(3)%type = 'Special_ShipEmis',

Can use a mix of SNAP and GNFR emission, if the type of the second is specified.
The first emission determines the main sector categories, the other emissions
will be mapped. For instance

  emis_inputlist(1)%name = '/global/work/nyiri/emis01deg_EMEP2015/GNFREmis_EMEP01_2015.nc',! GNFR

  emis_inputlist(3)%name     = '/global/work/mifapw/emep/Data/Emis_TNO7_MACCIII/Emis_TNO7_MACCIII_2011.nc',
  emis_inputlist(3)%type     = 'SNAPsectors',          !interpret as SNAP
  emis_inputlist(3)%incl(1:) = 'MED','NOS','ATL','BAS','BLS',

7th  June 2017  Peter

Allow for outputting sectorwise emission.
In ModelConstants_config set for instance:

BUG fix on apinene reactions - was reacting in two .reactions files

  - CHANGES results!

So, chemistry cleanup was the result, with new VBS system to keep the code
shorted and more visible.

VBS reactions and coefficients now dealt with in YieldModifications_mod, together
with new system in ZCM_EmChem16mt/VBS_SOAformationY.reactions. The new system
now makes use of labels, e.g. |YCOXY(1)| to set yields for different components
in different VBS bins. Here, from OXYL into 10**1 (ie 10ug/m3) bin.

ZCM_CRIv2R5/GenIn.shorthand
  Copied CRIv2R5jpc.shorthand to GenIn.shorthand

ZCM_EmChem16mt:

  Aero2017n.reactions:
    Added fine-mode O3 uptake on dust

 EmChem16mtbase.reactions:
    Cleaned out old C5H8 chemistry

 EmChem16mtbase.species:
    Removed TERPPeroxy, since we now use new VBS system

 VBS_SOAformationY.reactions  ---- NEW !!!
    uses new and improved YieldModifications for VBS

ChemFields_ml.f90
  Adding cell_tinv as 1/T for use in YieldModifications

ChemFunctions_ml.f90
  Added SmixC option to explore coarse-mode uptake. Not used yet.

mk.GenChem
  Used new SOAformation file for EmChem16mt - using YieldModification methods

config_EMEPSTD.nml
  Using YieldModification = VBS

emep_Config_mod.f90
  Made YieldModification = VBS default. Also safe for EmChem09soa; just wastes
a little CPU.

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD
   Added SQT output

Solver.f90
  Adapted for new VBS methods in YieldModifications

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
31st  May 2017  Peter

NetCDF_ml: bug in interpolation routine:
Can affect only cases where:
1)interpolation from lon-lat to lon-lat
and 2) the model grid has finer resoltion than the data interpolated (which is normally not the case)

Nest_ml.f90: option to save only the data at BC  of inner grid.
Set  "MET_inner" and "RUNDOMAIN_inner" in config.
Still under testing.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
24th  May 2017  Peter

run.pl: changed SLURM commands. There is a bug on Stallo, that makes MPI count
wrong the number of CPUs if not entire nodes are taken.

Introduced special2d and special3d arrays in MetFields.
If you need very special output (i.e some quantity that cannot be outputted by
standard My_Derived). For 2D fields
1) set Nspecial2d  in MetFields according to the number of new outputs
2) write in set in the code the values of the array special2d(i,j,N), where N is
   the output number (i.e. 1,2,... Nspecial2d).
   For instance special2d(i,j,1)=Grid%invL in CellMet_ml.f90 for invL
3) include in the same routine the use MetFields_ml  , only : special2d
4) In config_Output.nml include the line for instance
 'MyName','MET2D','special2d1', '-','MyUnit' ,-99,-99,F,1.0,T,'YMD',
(and 'special2d2', 'special2d3', ... for other outputs)

For 3D fields replace all the "2d" by "3d"

Redefined a group OX in ZCM_EmChem16mt/EmChem16mtbase.species

Some clean up (uemep rundomain, molecular weights,..)
presave loc_frac in advec microiterations.
zero order vert advection flag.
for zero order advection, uemep (for ppm) gives exactely the same result as SR,
also the 2nd, third neighbor. (one day test).

bug in uemep diffusion corrected
set advection to 4th order again

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
21st Apr 2017 Peter
Reorganization of uEMEP. Own uEMEP file with uemep routines.
uEMEP: for each gridcell computes fractions for a surrounding region.
Needs write out many dimensional data (i,j,k,t,sector, + x and y for origin of pollutant).
New routine in NetCDF_ml that writes many dimensional array.
Still need interface for input parameters and more checking.
Molecular mass of emissions/pollutant hardcoded now.

BIGGISH CHANGES CONTINUE. RESULTS HAVE CHANGED!!!!

Makefile - now uses EmChem16mt as default

ZCM_EmChem16mt/GenIn.shorthand - added. (Same as EmChem16mt.shorthand)

NEW CHEM:
ZCM_CRIv2R6jpc/ - CRI_v2_R5 with new isoprene from Mike Jenkin (via Robert)

BUG-FIXED emissplit:
ZCM_CRI_v2_R5/EMISSPLIT/emissplit.defaults.voc
   -  Garry H sent new file to replace old (and badly bugged) previous version
   -  old version had loads of BPINENE, new version hardly any.

run.pl - now checks for CRI pattern for emissplits

NEW FILE:
 YieldModifications_mod.f90
  - allows changes in e.g. yield coefficients during execution of
    Solver iterations.
  - only triggered with CRIv2R5 so far, for SOA yields and JPC testing

Associated changes:

config_EMEPSTD, config_EMEPGLOB - mentions YieldModifications

Makefile.SRCS - added YieldModifications_mod.f90

Solver_ml.f90 - calls YieldModifications if wanted

BIGGISH CHANGES CONTINUE. RESULTS HAVE CHANGED!!!!

1) LandConverInputs - config'd:

emep_Config_mod.f90
LandDef_ml.f90
Landuse_ml.f90
ModelConstants_ml.f90
config_EMEPSTD.nml
config_EMEPGLOB.nml

  -  Adding landcover file names and LandDefs, DO3SE inputs to config system.
  -  Defaults now from LandInputs_Apr2017, incl. glc2000mCLM.nc

run.pl

  - commented out links to Landuse_PS, LanduseGLC. Use config instead.

2) Mosaic outputs - config'd:

MosaicOutputs_ml.f90
My_Derived_ml.f90
config_Outputs_EMEPSTD

  - added NewMosaic, MOSIAC_METCONC, MET_LCS and Mosaic_timefmt to config
  - in future NewMosaic should replace other systems, but as with much else
    we are currently running partially completed upgrades..
  - also noticed that with new landcover system, outputs such as VG_O3_GR
    only apply to European part of globe, not to e.g. C3_NARC_GRASS. Need
    to modify to cover PFTs or ecosystem definitions.


3) ColumnSource_ml - reduced NMAX_LOC, NMAX_EMS to 5, 300 to avoid problems
   discussed on github issues.

   *  Action needed: Alvaro

4) NEW DEFAULT CHEM - EmChem16mt


NEW::: ZCM_EmChem16mt introduced
  (Dave/Robert/Hannah)

  Significant update of chemistry! Added monoterpenes, simple SQT, replaced
  isoprene chemistry. Fixed PAN rate coefficient bug.

  Contributions from Hannah Imhof and Robert Begström included.

NEW::: ZCM_EmChem16mt/Aero2017n.species, .reactions  introduced

   update/cleanup of  aerosol  reactions for N2O5 testing. May change in
   April as testing proceeds.


mk.GenChem  - defaults to new system

Setup_1d_ml - Added cNO3, cNO2 for N2O5 testing


5) Improved Fpart (Robert)
Aqueous_ml

   Corrected use of Fpart in dep calculations
   Expanded list of surrogates (e.g. CWDEP_0p5) for organics

6) BVOC, Dave

Biogenics_ml, emep_Config_mod

   Added explicit EmBio%CLF variable for default (non-Euro) BVOC
    - to be used with new LandInputs files

   Downgraded MEGAN. Now prefer to use GLC/CLM methods (to be commited soon!)

7) Misc

Derived_ml - changed YMD to YM for various not so important outputs (u_ref, Kz, Idirect, etc) to
  reduce size of Base_day.nc . Need to move to config soon!

DO3SE_ml

   Longer names allowed (to cope with CLM,eg BDLF_EVGN_TROP_TREE)

GasParticleCoeffs_ml

   Updated and extended. Higher PAN and HONO deposition.

LandDefs_ml

   Small tidy up, changed sub to dtxt for debug output

Landuse_ml

   Updated to cope with CLM
   Now allows landcover to be different in European and global files

ModelConstants_ml

   Moved GlobBvocMethod to emep_Config
   Extended NLANDUSEMAX to 40

My_Derived_ml

   Changed YMD to YM for mosaic outputs to reduce size of Base_day. This
   should really be done in config one day.

Setup_ml

   Added safety catch on RCT_USED in debug mode

run.pl

   Point to LandInputs_Apr2017 which has GLC-CLM based global use and
   appropriate Inputs files.

10th Mar 2017 Dave  rv4_12beta

BIG CHANGE FOR GLOBAL BVOC and also some structural changes

1)  emep_Config_mod.f90 - ** NEW **

  - will take over the non-constant stuff from ModelConstants one day
  - designed to ease merge of emep with ESX and BoxChem (we have an
    esx_Config and Box_Config also
  - currently just has:
       PBL type - with ZiMin, ZiMAN and HmixMethod
       EmBio type, with GlobBvocEmis, IsopFac, TerpFac

  BLPhysics_ml
  Met_ml
  ModelConstants_ml

  - all modified to use emep_Config_mod

  config_EMEPSTD.nml - just added commented out example for PBL%ZiMin

  Note: The _mod suffix is intended also for the merge with ESX/BoxChem -
        - I will use it to denote modules which have been updated/merged.

2) Biogenic changes

Biogenics_ml

  - Added MEGAN_ml within to look after MEGAN-like global BVOC
    (working version. Tripples global isoprene if used. Will be
     improved, but this should be the new default.)
  - now uses BIOTERP for terpene emissions, since APINENE is just one of
    many possible terpenes.

run.pl - linked to Megan4Emep.nc file

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09base.species/reactions - modified with BIOTERP

3) Wesely changes

Wesely_ml renamed to GasParticleCoeffs_ml
  - since it has less and less to do with Wesely, and for future ESX merge

4) GenChem changes

  - added option of variable yields on RHS of equations, with |YA_xx| notation, e.g.
    coded for gas and aerosol yields so far, e.g. to allow:
     A + B = |YG_isopO3| gas-phase-products + |YA_isopO3| aerosol-phase-products
    Needs more work.

5) Name changes

  Chem_ml -> ChemFields_ml, since it contained ChemFields_ml!

  CM_ChemSpecs_tmp.f90 ->  ChemSpecs_wrapper.f90 to be slightly more explicit
         and to avoid the mistake of rm CM_* and thinking only GenChem files
         will be removed

6) Defaults for n2o5Hydrolysis set to Smix, not SmixTen
   (THIS WILL CHANGE RESULTS IF USERS HAD FORGOTTEN TO EXPLICITLY SET Smix!)


  Makefile.SRCS - adapted to these changes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
24th Feb 2017 Peter

NetCDF_ml - fixed bug with GOBAL_SOILNOx which had been zero since ???

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
24th Feb 2017 Peter

Pre-advection of ColumnSources.
Define USE_PreADV=T in config to activate. (otherwise no effect).
The emissions from ColumnSources are distributed along a line.
The length and direction of the line is defined according to winds at each level.
The line is "one-dimensional" in the 2D layer.
The wind is defind only at origin (emission source), it is not varying along
the line. The number of gridcells on the line is equal to the Courant number in
each direction (nearest integer larger than C).

This is to avoid the problem of holes in the concentration when there are
strong wind, since the advection will move pollutants far away, while emissions
are put into the atmosphere only every dt_advec.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
22nd Feb 2017 Dave

ModelConstants_ml
Runchem_ml

  - Added DEBUG%datetxt - to add a date string which  can be accessed from
     other modules while debugging. Saves the need for TimeDate_ml,
     print_date etc.

Wesely_ml
  - massive expansion in number of species to cope with 2017 CRI
    chemistry. No change in resuls for EmChem09 though.

Allow (eventually) to set hours for start- and enddate in config file.
NB: run.pl changed (slightly), line 1092:
        ."  enddate   = ".date2str($enddate   ,"%Y,%m,%d,000024,\n")

NetCDF_ml: GetCDF_modelgrid can return units and validity (needed for Harmonie).


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9th Feb 2017 Peter

Problems from the new interpolation routine (26th Jan) for global grids:
the cyclic longitudes where not taken correctly into account.

The landuse could be numerically large than 1 (1E-15 over), and that caused
negative deposition over south pole for PB210. Added a "max(1,lu_cover)"

Found a few (3?) gridcell at south pole (left corner) in LanduseGLC.nc with 150%
lu coverage. Will replace with correct one.

  emis_inputlist(1)%pollName(1:2)     = 'voc','sox', !example of restricted choice of pollutants

By default (i.e. if the line is commented out), all pollutants are included.


Faster transformation from stereographic (landuse) for fine resolution model grids

dt_advec can be set by config file

removed the "only" in use MPI_Groups_ml. MPI_IN_PLACE is a special variable, and
it does not behave well under certain versions of gfortran (reported by Massimo)

Meaningful error message when Mask file (monthly emissions) not found

Attempt to clean the timings overview

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7th Dec 2016 Peter

top vertical level allowed to be exactly = top met level
The code stopped because of numerical differences when they where exactly =.

Better interpolation for fine resolution model grids:
Bilinear interpoaltion is used when going interpolating from a coarse lat-lon grid
into a fine resolution model grid (specially useful for emissions).
Also the interpolation from polarstereographic is now using a finer subdivision of
gridcells; this may however increase the time for interpolating landuse.

run.pl - changed links to volcano emissions and locations.
         New data files for volcano emissions were made. We include now
         passive degassing from three volcanoes: Stromboli, Etna, Vulcano. We
         use emissions as reported by CEIP in the new files, not our
         defaults. This will lead to a significant decrease of SOx from VOL for
         recent years, while there will be an increase for the 1990s and early
         2000s.

More flexible definitions of sectors.
Now we can define new sectors grouping (like GNFR).

NB: it is easy to get confused, about what is mapped and what is not!

Definitions:
NSECTORS: number of sectors defined in emission file
N_TFAC: Number of timefactor classes defined
N_HFAC: Number of height distribution classes defined
N_SPLIT: Number of speciation classes defined
In principle these could all be different.

The mapping arrays give the value of the index for each of the sector emissions:
sec2tfac_map
sec2hfac_map
sec2split_map

The values are set (they are actually pointers) by the maps defined.
For example if "USE_SNAP=T", the emissions are mapped to the indices using:
SNAP_sec2tfac_map
SNAP_sec2hfac_map
SNAP_sec2split_map
For now they simply return the same value: SNAP_sec2tfac_map(i)=i

Adding new sectors can be done by defining these 3 maps for the new sectors.

Not fully tested yet!

Moved the definition of meteorological path into config file.
set the path with the exact version (metdata_VERSION) if you want to be
sure to run with a constant version of the meteo!

Also DegreeDays is now set automatically (or can be defined manually in config
use "DegreeDayFactorsFile=/MY/PATH/HDDMYNAME.nc").
keyword "GRID" defined in run.pl (and put by run.pl into config); this is to
avoid situations where definitions in the config and run.pl are defined differently.
(that is also the reason that I couldn't move entirely &INPUT_PARA into the code)

startdate and enddate variables moved to ModelConstants (was in TimeDate).

Output_hourly,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml
- The following hourly types produce output available from Derived:
  ADVppbv, BCVppbv, ADVugXX, BCVugXX, ADVugXXgroup, BCVugXXgroup,
  PMwater, PMwaterSRF, Z_MID, dZ_BND, COLUMN, COLUMNgroup,
  D2D_inst, D3D_inst, D2D_accum, D3D_accum, D2D_mean, D3D_mean.
- This output types are disabled and their usage in
  set_output_defs (My_Outputs_ml) will produce a run time error.
- If needed, these hourly output types (except D2D/D3D)
  can be enabled by setting ENFORCE_HOURLY_DERIVED=.false. in Output_hourly.

ModelConstants_ml,My_Derived_ml,Derived_ml,NetCDF_ml:
- New user defined variables num_lev3d,lev3d (ModelConstants_ml)
  hold the number and list of levels to be included on Derived 3D output.
- New user defined variable lev3d_from_surface (My_Derived_ml),
  indicate that the levels listed in lev3d are from source.
- num_lev3d,lev3d,lev3d_from_surface are read in OutputSize_config namelist (My_Derived_ml).
- By default all model levels, from model top to surface,
  will be outputted for 3D Derived output.

Derived_ml,My_Derived_ml:
- Changes to 3d MISC output:
  - PM25water, previously called PM25water3d, outputs PM25_water (ambient).
    Note that 2d version outputs PM25_water_rh50 (50%rh, 20C);
  - New PM25, same as 2d output;
  - New PM25_wet/PM10_wet, same definition than PM25_rh50/PM10_rh50,
    but with PM25water at ambient conditions.
  - Z_BND/ZMID, same as in Output_hourly, previously called Zbnd_3d/Zmid_3d.
  - New dZ_BND, same as in Output_hourly, output level thickness.

  are updated by default. Optional argument ONLY_IOU, makes possible to
  update only IOU_INST and IOU_HOUR (call Derived(..,ONLY_IOU=IOU_HOUR)).
- Wrtchem optional argument ONLY_HOUR makes possible to write and reset only
  IOU_HOUR and IOU_HOUR_INST outputs (call Wrtchem(ONLY_HOUR=IOU_HOUR).
- This options will be used on FORECAST mode, to produce "zero hour" output.
- FORECAST mode Output_fields shows that finished writing to filename_iou(iotyp),
  by adding a line into the corresponding *.msg file.

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml,config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml

19th April, Dave  3167

testing system:

NEW: mk.testX and utils/fmkmf

Usage: e.g.  mk.testX  SmallUtils.f90

This will create a small test program testX_SmallUtils, and a Makefile
testX_Makefile_SmallUtils. The code will be compiled and run.

Requirement: to run this, some code at the end of the module has make
a proper program, but be commented out this !DSX (sorry for the DS, this
was TSTESX in ESX and I ran out of imagination for Unimod..)

Example:

   module SmallUtils_ml
   ....
   end module SmallUtils_ml

   !DSX program tester
   !DSX   use SmallUtils_ml, only : Self_test
   !DSX   call Self_test()
   !DSX end program tester

(where here we also have put a self_test routine in the module. This
 isn't essential, but often very useful.)

Fix error on the file describes the SO2 passive degassing from volcanoes (volcano_emission.csv).
The vertical description of the emission from Etna and Stromboli are wrong.
The emission is too high and it is spread in several levels.
volcano_emission.csv was introduced on 3009 (May 2015).
As far as I can tell, the effect is rather localized.

ColumnSource_ml:
- Read model surface high [m asl] (from topography.nc) and
  correct vent elevation [m asl] from (volcano_location.csv),
  so base and top of each emission are relative to the model surface.
- Use 'MLEV' in as the base descriptor (*_emission.csv) to indicate the

INTERIM, needs further checks!!!
(and for changes to be passed to more complex SOA, as well as SR versions, etc)

NEW: SOA_ml.f90 replaces ZD_OZONE/My_SOA_ml.f90 and ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml.f90

Main changes:

1) SOA handling modified. Helper species (e.g. PART_ASOA_OC) removed from
  ZCM_vbs_tests and My_SOA removed, since these were for output only. Instead,
  the outputs can now be obtained through config with ugPM....

2) ugPM units handling added to Derived_ml and Units_ml, to handle species or
groups which involve semivolatile species (ie SOA!).

3) ZD_VBS directory deleted. Empty after My_SOA_ml removed

Chem_ml.f90 - made allocation of Fgas3d depend on FIRST_SEMIVOL>0

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml - modified to use ugPM (need to change other Outputs, but not today.)

Derived_ml - added ugPM to cope with groups which have semivolatile components
             changes in group_calc to accept semivol argument


mk.GenChem - removed  VBS_help.species

ModelConstants_ml - removed DEBUG_SOA since we have DEBUG%SOA

RunChem_ml - calls Reset_OrganicAerosols, which resets OM25_BGND and OM25_SUM
  to correct for any changes (emissions, etc.)

Units_ml
  - added do_Units_Scale subroutine which is intended to replace the
     Units_Scale functions. The problem with the functions is that they
     could modify arguments, not just return values.

ZCM_EmChem09soa/VBS_nonvolatile species - added OM25_BGND, OM25_SUM and OM25 groups
ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_help.species - not needed any more for EmChem09soa. Likely needs
  modification if wanted for any other VBS setup.
ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_nonvolatile.species - modifications started until I realised that
   ZCM_EmChem09soa has a file with the same name. mk.GenChem uses the latter, so
   the vbs_tests version will likely be deleted shortly.
ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_partitioning.species - group OM25 added - this is essential now
   for SOA species.

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml - just increased MAX_NUM_DERIV2D to 250


(Changes marked with FSOA and XSOA. Will be cleaned further in next iterations.)


NEW: SOA_ml.f90
DELETED: ZD_OZONE/My_SOA_ml
DELETED: ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml
Makefile.SRCS - SOA_ml replaces My_SOA_ml

Extended flexibility for emis_inputlist.
Developed for new Ocean emission files with NH3 and DMS.
Can be read by adding in config file:

  emis_inputlist(2)%name  = 'EmisDir/geia_emissions_nh3_ocean_0.5x0.5.nc',    ! Ocean NH3
  emis_inputlist(2)%type  = 'OceanNH3',    ! Needs ad-hoc treatment
  emis_inputlist(3)%name  = 'EmisDir/DMS.nc',    !Global DMS in Oceans
  emis_inputlist(3)%type  = 'DMS',    ! Needs ad-hoc treatment

NB: this will include NH3, but not SO2 from DMS.
To replace our traditional natso2.dat emissions by the new SO2 values,
in addition USE_OCEAN_DMS must be set T in ModelConstants_ml.f90.
(this is temporarily while we test).

If USE_OCEAN_DMS=F the budget will still be calculated

ModelConstants_ml,Unimod.f90,OutputChem_ml,NetCDF_ml:
- New output type IOU_HOUR_INST=6.
- Instantaneous hourly fields (IOU_HOUR_INST) will be written to 'Base_hourInst.nc'.
- IOU_YEAR_LASTHH=6 is not longer used, and will be removed on the near future.

Derived_ml,config_BM-EECCA.nml:
- Deprecate output type "USTAR_NWP", use "MET2D","ustar_nwp" in OutputMisc instead.
- Reduce LENOUT2D from IOU_YEAR_LASTHH=6 to IOU_HOUR=5, as the last field is no longer used.

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml,Output_hourly.f90:
- Move output fror MY_OUTPUTS="MACC_EVA" and "MACC_NMC" to hourly Derived.
- Move DEBUG_PBL and DEBUG_PM10 additional output to hourly Derived.
- Deprecate D2D/D3D output types, as they are now available directly from Derived.
  It is possible to re-instate this output types by setting parameters
  DxD_DEPRECATED=.true. (Output_hourly) and
  LENOUT2D=IOU_YEAR_LASTHH (Derived_ml).
- Hourly output types "theta" and "sh" can now output
  other levels for other KMAX_MID.

PhyChem_ml:
- On FORECAST mode, write hourly Derived outputs before
  the 1st advection step (zero hour).

Units_ml:
- Add pollen grains as possible output unit.

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml,config_Outputs_EMEPSR.nml:
- Update comments "freq ... IOU_HOUR=5, IOU_HOUR_INST=6"

run.pl,config_Outputs_CAMS50.nml:
- New output configurations for CAMS50 (formerly MACC) runs.
- Place tared copy of the source files (Unimod*.tar.bz2) on $RESDIR/
  if/when $MAKEMODE specified.

Nest_ml:
On subroutine wrtxn
- Remove printout for each time filename_write is not found.
- Parameter APPEND can be used to append new time steps to filename_write.

Makefile:
- Add HTAP compilation target. Like EMEP, but with GFED forest fires.
- Fix GFAS forest fire version. Set MACC targets tu use GFASv1.
  On 3018 MACC targets were wrongly set to GFASv1.5.

ZCM_EmChem09soa/BiomassBurning_*_to_EmChem09soa.inc,
ZCM_EmChem09ecom/BiomassBurning_*_to_EmChem09ecom.inc:
- Correct BiomassBurningMapping parameter to include soa/ecom.

GridValues_ml,NetCDF_ml,Sites_ml,PointSource_ml:
- Integer interface for lb2ij, offering a consistent rounding for coordinates
  right on the boundary between grid-cells/processor-subdomains.

Cleaned up config_EMEPSTD.nml and config_EMEPGLOB.nml
Cleaned up "yearly" emis output when monthly emis
Clearer error message when Array size exceeded
Corrected old bug that caused PrintCDF to crash if the file existed already :)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
29-30th november 2015 Peter 3094-6

Bugs in Sites_ml.f90.
Appears for 160 CPU on a ASIA run, but not when run on 40 procs.
The netcdf finds non-allowed values to output, and the values outputted seem wrong (infinite, 0, etc)
Corrected some array indices.
Initialized out=0.0 for sondes.
Two MPI tags had the same values (tag=347); this could cause the code to mix up sends,
when many CPU where waiting.
Added a +1.0E-7 in:
ix=nint(x+1.0E-7)
In special cases when
1) the station is exactely at a boundary between two gridcells
2) the station is exactely at a boundary between two subdomains
3) the last bit in the rounding is different between MasterProc and owner CPU
then the number of stations in the CPU and MasterProc are no more in sync!

Homogenize the definitions of output sub domains across the model

NetCDF_ml:
- Use hour_DOMAIN for IOU_3DHOUR type (subroutine Init_new_netCDF).
- replace optional input variables ist,jst,ien,jen by out_DOMAIN
  (subroutines Out_netCDF and WriteCDF).

Nest_ml,ZD_Pollen/Pollen_ml,
config_EMEPSTD.nml,config_IMPACT2C.nml,config_EMEPGLOB.nml,config_FORECAST.nml:
- replace user variables istart,jstart,iend,jend read in Nest_config
  by out_DOMAIN (subroutines Config_Nest, wrtxn and pollen_dump)

Output_hourly,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml,OwnDataTypes_ml:
- Use hour_DOMAIN for hourly netcdf output and
  remove ix1,ix2,iy1,iy2 from Asc2D type
  (subroutine hourly_out, set_output_defs and print_Asc2D).

Output_hourly:
- add specific humidity hourly output type ("sh").

config_BM-EECCA.nml
- remove garbage after OutputDep_config namelist.

GridValues_ml:
- Extend RestrictDomain so it accepts wildcards,
  eg [10,20,-1,-1] implies [10,20,RUNDOMAIN(3),RUNDOMAIN(4)].
- Add consistency check for RestrictDomain

Changes/updates from MACC (now CAMS50) FORECAST/ANALYSIS set-up

Nest_ml:
- FORECAST mode accepts out_DOMAIN. Use RUNDOMAIN as default.

config_FORECAST.nml:
- Use 'CdfFractions' instead of 'emislist' (deprecated).
- Add Machine_config namelist

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09base.species:
- remove SHIPNOX from DAOBS group.

ZD_3DVar/Makefile
- Requere module fftw/3.3.3 for intelcomp/13.0.1
  or module fftw/3.3.4  for intelcomp/14.0.1.

ZD_3DVar/Analysis/DA_3DVar_ml:
- Fix bug for ANALYSIS on 32 CPUs.The error was unnoticed as we only
  run with 16 CPUs because hyper-treading slows down FFTW3.

Bug in nesting for restricted domain introduced in 3070.
Also some inconsistency with netcdfID for non-master corrected.
Restricted Nest domain output now possible for MODE 10 also

The model will stop if the Nest will find an existing "EMEP.OUT" when writing.

Restricted domain output:
choose size of domain in the output files in config_Outputs.nml Example
&OutputSize_config
    fullrun_DOMAIN = 1,100,1,100 ,
    month_DOMAIN =   100,300,1,100 ,
    day_DOMAIN =     1,100,90,100 ,
    hour_DOMAIN =    50,100,50,100
&end

3087: corrected bug in NetCDF, when using nesting. (all processors in stead of only masterproc
where opening the file, and not closing)

3088: more bugs corrected for restricted domain and stereographic projections
3089: increased size of WRITE_SPC and WRITE_GRP in Nest_ml
3090: Stop Nest_ml *at start of run*, when the write file exists.
      Defined the time for "hourly", as middle of period. Hourly is averaged over the hour.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
18th  November 2015 Peter   3084

Hourly outputs now possible with same interface as daily, monthly, yearly.
Choose "5" for period.
This is supposed to be used mostly for 2D fields.


The "old format" hourly files setup are now sent to XXX_3Dhour.nc
This should be used for special uses: restricted area or vertical levels, CAMS,
nesting(?).
replaced some "hourly" by "3Dhourly" for the "old format" hourly.

- Move FREQ_HOURLY from My_Outputs_ml to ModelConstants_ml.
- Set FREQ_HOURLY FREQ_HOURLY as a user variable,
  read trough ModelConstants_config namelist.

ModelConstants_ml:
- Small bug fix: NETCDF_DEFLATE_LEVEL and HOURLYFILE_ending were
  twice on ModelConstants_config.

Output_hourly,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml:
- Add D3D hourly types: D3D_inst, D3D_accum & D3D_mean.
- Hourly output for MY_OUTPUTS="MACC_NMC":
    AOD_550nm(D2D_inst), EXT_550nm(D3D_inst),
    PMFINE(BCVugXXgroup) & PM10(BCVugXXgroup).

BUG FIXES!!! - results will change for Smix and SmixTen gamma values
  The fsia (SO4/(SO4+NO3)) was being uses as 1-fsia. Also, the
  gamma for NO3 was being added instead of weighted.
  The changes are not very dramatic, but not trivial. The code needs
  to be tested again for best gamma. (For Dave's global runs Smix is
  still clearly best.)

Bug in the defintion of vertical levels in netcdf output files, introduced in
version 3070.
Only the values/defintion of the vertical levels written are wrong, the data is correct.

"Extended" Massbudget now also with consistent units.

3D met output enabled for fields defined in "met%".
In config_Outputs.nml, set for instance
'rho_airdensity',  'MET3D', 'air_density', '-', 'kg/m3', -99,  -99,      F,   1.0, T, 3,

Small bug in monthly emissions corrected (no effect on results,
but could trigger a false error if run with debug=yes).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd  November 2015 Peter  3073

Removed almost all maxlimax and maxljmax. They are replaced by limax and ljmax.
That means that arrays in different subdomains can have different declared
sizes.
This matters only when arrays are sent with MPI: otherwise the subdomains
do not need to "know" the size of teh other subdomains.

The local2global/global2local approaches still need maxlimax/maxljmax, but these
are on the way out. local2global has been removed already.
ReadField (ASCII), also needs it. It is only in use for DMS.

Note that the advection scheme (even if subdomains are exchanging info at boundaries)
do not need maxlimax/maxljmax, because the adjacent borders always are of same size.

I did a brutal
sed -i 's/MAXLIMAX/LIMAX/g' *90
and then corrected the few places where it should still be maxlimax

The results should be identical. (Tested only 1 day EECCA).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd  November 2015 Peter  3072

New "Machine_config". The code tries the different "Datapath" until it finds one

Derived_ml.f90 NetCDF_ml.f90 Met_ml.f90 GridValues_ml.f90 ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml.f90

EmisGet_ml, Emissions_ml: removed the "emislist" option. Removed arrays that run over the fulldomain
(glat_fdom, glon_fdom, globemis, globland, globnland, flat_globnland, flat_globland, globemis_flat).
carea removed (it was still based on sigma coordinates) (Massbudget_ml)
Advecdiff and Advecdiff_poles removed
Removed routines GlobalPosition DefGrid and Position.

Had to rewrite Init_new_netCDF and CreatenetCDFfile to avoid using glat_fdom and glon_fdom.
CreatenetCDFfile_Eta removed (replaced by the new CreatenetCDFfile).
Out_netCDF is still using fulldomain arrays, but this will be corrected another time.

Derived_ml and My_Derived_ml; put a line
         if(outdim=='3d')Is3D=.true.
for the "MISC" case. (not sure about this, but I can't see that it can harm)

Did a lot of testing (PS, lon-lat,wrf and GLOBAL grids), but there may still be
bugs (many possibilities for special cases)
Results should almost not be affected: <1E-4 relative max error, due to slightly
different extrapolation at domain boundaries. For PS projection the definition
of gridareas (xm2 and xmd) is slightly different (<1E-5).

AOD_PM_ml:
- Fix bug on DRY mode AOD calculations:
  - On DRY mode, AOD calculations missed the cross-section to surface transformation.
  - NOc calculation was inconsistent between DRY and WET modes.
  - The bugs were introduced in 2665 (November 2013), but did not become active
    until 2994 (April 2015), when the description of dust types (DDf & DDc) on
    Dust.species and VBS_nonvolatile.species were explicitly set to DRY mode
    (DDf:dry and DDc:dry).
- Use a constant grow factor of 1.0 for non hygroscopic components.
- Consistently set ECn as non hygroscopic.
- Add consistency checks for Qm_ref array.

AOD_PM_ml,GenChem.pl,
ZCM_EmChem09/Dust.species,ZCM_EmChem09soa/VBS_nonvolatile.species:
- Do not allow different DRY or WET mode calculations for different AOD components.
  All AOD components will be treated the same, all WET or all DRY.

PhyChem_ml:
- On FORECAST, update derived before hourly output for zero hour.

config_EMEPSTD.nml:
- Remove garbage at the end of the file.

14th September 2015 Dave 3046-3047

Most AOT and POD type definitions moved to config  system - enables simpler
changes in the settings, and varying output frequency through iotype.
NOTE - changes done for EMEPSTD so far. Needs to be done for SR, other...

AOTnPOD_ml
- All O3cl settings removed - moved to config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml
- O3cl_t (was O3cl) now has iotype
- is_EU, is_MM, is_XX logicals added to help clear up confusions and
  chase down a possible bug in AOT (to be continued)
- debug stuff cleaned and extended,

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD:
- added new section for PODs and AOTs

Mosaics_ml
- modified for O3cl_t
- and iotype usage

My_Derived_ml
- All POD/AOT defintions removed
- older commented-out code for COLUMN removed

SMALL TIDY-UPS (as 3046):

Derived_ml
- small debug changes
- tmp comment-out of iadv_EC_C_WOOD type checks. Killed EmChem09 runs!

DerivedFields_ml
- removed copyright

Landuse_ml
- small debug changes

Sites_ml
- small debug changes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
13th September 2015 Dave 3045

More clean-ups -
Aero_Vds_ml - deleted commented out lines from older code
DefPhotolysis - removed copyright text
DryDep_ml - clean up, and added surf_o3_ppb1 to capture O3 after deposition
  loss (o3_ppb was before)
LocalVariables - added surf_o3_ppb1
ModelConstants - removed mention of Riemer stuff
Setup_1d_ml - removed old comments concerning bugs, old setup_nh3 (FUTURE) code
    and general clean-up

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9th September 2015 Dave 3044

Small clean-ups - removed older !CMR comments and copyright text and 'Unified'
from Nest_ml, ExternalBICs_ml, Dust_ml, Output_hourly.f90 and My_SOA_ml.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7-8th September 2015 Peter 3041-3

"Mixed" format for emissions put as default in ModelConstants_ml.f90 and removed
from config_EMEPSTD.nml.
Old bug in the "inclusive countries": all countries were always taken.
See example of use in config_EMEPSTD.nml or ask Peter or Semeena
Mixed format can combine several emission sources files, netcdf or ASCII.
Can include some countries, or exclude some countries for each emission file
Can NOT interpolate the ASCII emissions.

for ASCII emissions, pollutants names must be expressed with the keyword "POLL",
and will be replaced with the names defined in CM_EmisFiles.inc. These are in
lowercases. The link is now provided in the run.pl, but new emissions
should preferably be defined directly with lowercases (gridsox...)

In the longer term pathes should be defined in config file, and not run.pl
so that we can remove completely run.pl at some stage. This will make it easier
to backtrace pathes of files used by the model.

Indices of emis_inputlist must start at 1 and increase by 1 at a time
(no undefined inputs in between defined inputs)

Emis4D: reverse k order

Some clean ups

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd September 2015 Peter 3037-3040

Safer clean up for modrun.sh:
remove all links

Met_ml kmax->kmax_mid (wrf met)
Changed SMI formula for SMI (wrf)
Test for positive precipitations (wrf)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd September 2015 Peter 3036

New method for reducing emissions by coordinates.
Included in our "femis.dat" as lines starting by the keyword lonlat.
Example of valid femis.dat file:
Name  7         sox       nox        co       voc       nh3      pm25      pmco
 8    0        0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0
 lonlat 1.0 3.0 46.5 50.0    0   0.0       0.0       1.0       1.0       1.0       1.0       1.0
 lonlat 11.0 13.0 58.0 62.0  0   1.0       0.0       1.0       1.0       1.0       1.0       1.0

The lonlat lines have the format:
lonlat minlon maxlon minlat max lat sector reduction1 reduction2 ....

lonlat and "normal" lines can be mixed, and it is always the product of all reductions which is used.
(It is however not allowed to cross the longitude=180 degrees line, i.e have minlon on one side and maxlon on the other)
Should work for all gridded emissions (tested for ASCII, "Mixed" ASCII, "Mixed" fractions)

Output femis.dat into RunLog, as it is important to keep track of reductions

Removed OH from config_Output.nml, as it was crashing the code

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20th August 2015 Peter 3034-3035

Adaptation of the code to handle WRF metdata directly. (and cleanups)

Met_ml, MetFields_ml: many new WRF names defined.
3D Precipitations done by:
1) make surface precip by adding RAINNC and RAINC
2) fetch QRAIN which is 3D but instantaneous. Smooth horizontally with smoosp,
   smooth in time by adding values at begin and end of met period.
3) scale surface precip vertically according to QRAIN
4) if QRAIN=0 but still have surcafe precip, use humidity instead

METSTEP set to WRF value automatically.

TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml

NetCDF_ml: change of extrapolation method for below lowest or above highest level
(no extrapolation but take lowest/highest value)

AirEmis_ml: above max height (19000m?) set emissions to zero (was "out of bounds bug")

GridValues_ml: check for lowest level thick enough

ModelConstants_ml: METSTEP variable instead of parameter. USE_WRF_MET_NAMES in namelist

SmallUtils_ml: do not stop if to many words , but take the first ones. Needed because wrf metdata has
"00:00:00" which can be interpreted as three words when ":" is used as delimiter.

Nest_ml: do not output lots info if MODE=0
AOTnPOD_ml: commented out some output
Site_ml: more characters in strings
run.pl: removed $DATA_LOCAL from list of necessary directories (now nothing is required!).

To use wrf met you must
in run.pl:
$METformat="$MetDir/wrfout_d01_YYYY-MM-DD_00:00:00";
(and define emissions, for instance $CDF_EMIS="Emis_GLOB_05.nc";)
unset degreedays setup.
You can but do not need use "Vertical_levels.txt"; WRF levels can be used, but
be careful then with definition of emis heights.

in config_EMPSTD.nml:
USE_WRF_MET_NAMES = .true.
USES%DEGREEDAY_FACTORS = F
(and possibly forest fire ...)

no change of results if you use standard setups.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14th August 2015 Peter, Heiko 3033

New emission input possibility, "Emis_4D.nc".
These must be given in the fulldomain with all vertical levels as hourly intervalls.
At present no space interpolation is performed.
The emissions will then sum up into the model ("smoothly" in Reaction.inc).
So far only use in EEMEP.
To use this, specify   EMIS_SOURCE = 'Mixed' in config file,
then add lines in the form:
emis_inputlist(1)%name = '/global/work/mifapw/emep/snap/Emis_4D.nc', !name of input file
emis_inputlist(1)%pollName(1) = 'Cs137_concentration_dump_ml', !Name of 1st pollutant in file
emis_inputlist(1)%pollemepName(1) = 'NPP22L689_CS137', !Name of 1st pollutant in "CM_ChemSpecs_ml.f90
emis_inputlist(1)%pollName(2) = 'I131_concentration_dump_ml', !Name of 2nd pollutant in file
emis_inputlist(1)%pollemepName(2) = 'NPP22L689_I131', !Name of 2nd pollutant in "CM_ChemSpecs_ml.f90
emis_inputlist(1)%pollName(3) = 'Xe-133_concentration_dump_ml', !Name of 3rd pollutant in file
emis_inputlist(1)%pollemepName(3) = 'NPP22L689_XE133', !Name of 3rd pollutant in "CM_ChemSpecs_ml.f90

The pollutants must start with indice 1, then 2 ... (no empty indices)
At present the pollutants are assumed given every hour and with unit molecules/m3

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

2nd August 2015 Dave, 3032, rv4.7.1

(I think rv4.8 can with full implementation of SHIPNOX, if results are as
  promising as first tests.)


** SHIPNOX introduced into chemistry, but not yet implemented into EMISSPLITS
   (see model updates chapter in EMEP Report R2015)

   Use of SHIPNOx will give large changes in O3 in global modelling at least. If used,
   use Smix (not SmixTen!) for the N2O5 hydrolysis - the shipping and N2O5 rates both affect and
   depend on oceanic NOx.


** BUG FIX version of Setup_ml. Results  may change a little

1) SHIPNOx

ZCM_EmChem09/
    EmChem09.species - added SHIPNOX, similar to NO2
    EmChem09.reactions - added:

      TROE_NO2_OH  SHIPNOX + OH + {M}  = HNO3   ; A97,J
      3.2e-5       SHIPNOX             = HNO3   ;
      - latter gives half-life of  6h, loosely based on dark experiments of Vinken et al, ACP,2009

    EmChem09/EMISSPLIT/emissplit.xxx.nox
    - added SHIPNOX as possible fraction, and with 47% NO, 3% NO2 and 50% SHIPNOX for INTISHIPS (cc350)


    NOTE - SHIPNOX not yet used for EmChem09soa chemistry. This is partly for safety while others
    have the chance to test and comment, and partly as the run.pl SplitDir system needs a good
    clean up.

2) BUG FIX
Setup_ml
  - use of pevious ugRemF = max(ugRemF, 1.0e-9) could cause aero_fom > 1 for very
    small ug/m3 levels. This could cause negative Sarea and negative rate uptake rates!
  - now fixed
  - added extra check on 1st call for any rct < 0


3) Other

For global crops assessments:

 AOTnPOD_ml,
  - Added IrrigatedWheat and NonIrrig wheat for work with ICP-Veg global modelling
 ZD_OZONE/My_Derived
  - Added IrrigatedWheat and NonIrrig wheat for work with ICP-Veg global modelling
  - now as daily output, to allow post-processing over different growing seasons
 run.pl, /global/work/mifapw/emep/Data/LandInputs_Jul2015/
  - now uses /global/work/mifapw/emep/Data/LandInputs_Jul2015/ data to get specs
    for irrigated and non-irrigated wheat.
 SubMet_ml
  - now sets fSW for landcovers with Irrigated in name. Very crude - should do this
    via input files!

DO3SE_ml
  - small debug changes

Emissions_ml
  - Added more flexible naming system, to allow POLL in middle of string to be used.

LandDefs_ml
  - small debug changes

Landuse_ml
  - some minor changes to prepare for Paleo and other external files

RunChem_ml
  - check_negs routine added for extra checks, when e.g. negative concs found somehere
    (triggered by DEBUG%RUNCHEM)

TimeDate_ml
  - can now call print_date without argument. Defaults to current_date
  - removed GNU info.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
8th July 2015 Dave, 3031

XNCOL system introduced to add column totals of short (or long)-lived species
to d_2d system.

Setup_1d_ml
- XNCOL system added into reset_3d routine, since this is afer chemical processing.
  Column total from dot_product(xn_2d(ispec,:),deltaZcm(:))

Setup_1dfields_ml, Chem_mk
 - added deltaZcm - thickness of layers in cm.

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD
 - examples added, with caveat/warnign test:
     ! Column data. Note that these data are compiled just after the chemistry step,
     ! and are probably best used for short-lived species. REMEMBER that boundary
     ! cells are not calculated, hence expect zeros on edges.

    OH - very useful and reason for this change
    NO2 - for comparison to NO2 from COLUMN system. The latter uses concentrations from
           after the advection step, and also produces values at domain edge.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
7th July 2015 Peter, Massimo  3029-30

Chem_ml: S_m2m3=0.0 (to avoid debug false errors when ":" is used)
Derived_ml: output lowest level when 3D metfield is asked for (real 3D not
yet functionning)

Lots of changes to allow the model to use directly WRF output as metdata.
tested for rotated spherical projection (climatrans).
Met_ml
MetFields_ml
GridValues_ml
NetCDF_ml

No change in results.

1st July 2015 Peter  3028

EmisGet_ml: emission height. Bug when defined as P levels (not default)
(loop over nemis_kprofile instead of nemis_hprofile)

GridValues_ml: deallocate xm_global (should be removed completely one day!)

NetCDF: vertical interpolate. Completed change from 3025.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
25th June 2015 Dave  3027

EmisGet_ml
Emissions_ml

  Tidy up, while checking (succesful) use of Mixed netcdf inputs
  (clearer debug, lines shortened < 78 chars, etc., old comments removed)

config_EMEPSTD.nml
  Extra comments to remind that Mixed soures need POLL, not explicit sox, etc

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
24th June 2015 Heiko 3026

Increase number of emissions in columnsource. Fukushima hourly, 3 heights
required already 1200, so increased to 10000

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23rd June 2015 Peter 3025

Vertical interpolation for NetCDF input:
When extrapolating for altitude higher than the input data, use a ribust scheme,
i.e. something which is bounded by the values in the two highest availbale
levels. (Not explicitely tested for these high altitudes though).
Should be useful when including stratosphere in the runs,
but O3 is not important for instance (eemep/volcanoes).

New set of emissions for FINN: "v15".
Requires new BiomassBurningMapping.inc
ZCM_EmChem09soa/BiomassBurning_FINNv1.5_to_EmChem09soa.inc
ZCM_EmChem09/BiomassBurning_FINNv1.5_to_EmChem09.inc

Makefile and run.pl modified to use the new ones

modified mk.GenChem and ForestFire_ml.f90 also

Notes on FINN ForestFire for 2012:
ForestFire_Emis_2012.nc is omewhat special: it is build from
GLOBAL_2012_GESOCHEM_04222014.txt (=FINNv1_2012_GESOCHEM_04222014.tgz) which
has still the v1 tag, but it has the same components as the v15 version.
i.e. ForestFire_Emis_2012.nc differs from ForestFire_Emis_v15_2012.nc but has
same components!
ForestFire_Emis_2012.nc was used for 2012 model runs up to now.

8th June 2015 Peter 3016-17

Some corrections for making the code run on abel and also with "DEBUG=yes".

TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml, ExternalBICs_ml : compiler on abel did not like the form:
 module procedure :: secs1970_to_ts,secs...

Met_ml: Kz_m2s_toSigmaKz called with (1:limax,1:ljmax,:) also for Kz_m2s.
BoundaryConditions_ml: does not read Dust.nc when USE_DUST=.false.

ColumnSource_ml did read long names. set TXTLEN_NAME = 50 in ModelConstants_ml (was 20)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5th June 2015 Agnes 3015

Country_ml:

Mace Head correction for 2013 added

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd June 2015 Peter 3013-4

NetCDF_ml:
Removed the "flight levels" (Airplane emissions) part of the ReadField_CDF routine,
and put it in an new ad hoc routine ReadField_CDF_FL.
The flight levels are a special vertical coordinates not used elsewhere.

This allows to remove the "recursive" requirement from the routine and in the Makefile.

One small step towards a better world.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
28th May 2015 Peter 3011

NetCDF_ml:
New parameter "rotated_pole" to conform to NCL and CF convention(?), in case of
rotated lat lon projection.
ReadField_CDF: "stagg" for staggered interpolation of wind fields.

ModelConstants_ml, Met_ml, GridValues_ml:
Possibility to define new grid projection manually without explicit metdata.
Under development, but used for CARBONORD project already.

OutputChem_ml: write out also in test run with one iteration.

Emissions_ml, run.pl: small comments changed

28th May 2015 Alvaro 3009-10

Volcanos_ml,Emergency_ml,ColumnSource_ml,Makefile.SRCS:
- Implement volcanic passive degassing of SO2 (previously in Volcanos_ml)
  into Emergency_ml.
- Rename Emergency_ml (with SO2 from volcanoes) to ColumnSource_ml.
- Remove deprecated modules: Volcanos_ml and Emergency_ml.
- Set USE_ASH=T (F by default) in ModelConstants_config namelist
  to read historical ASH emissions from Eyjafjallajökull's 2010 and Grimsvotn's 2011 eruptions into the ASH group.
- The ASH group is only available on EmChem09, EmChem09soa and Emergency schemes.
  ColumnSource_ml will write a warning into RunLog when USE_ASH=T but
  the ASH group is not found.
- Note that for periodic events, eg eruption the 15th of each month,
  it is better to run full months in order to ensure the vent is picked up.

ModelConstants_ml,Derived_ml,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml,
config_EMEPSTD.nml,config_BM-EECCA.nml,
config_FORECAST.nml,config_EMERGENCY.nml,
config_EMEPGLOB.nml,config_IMPACT2C.nml:
- Rename USE_EMERGENCY to USE_ASH.
- Rename/merge DEBUG_VOLC and DEBUG_EMERGENCY to  DEBUG_COLSRC.
- Change SOURCE_RECEPTOR from a parameter,
  to a user variable to be read in ModelConstants_config.
- Add VOLCANO_SR user variable read in ModelConstants_config,
  for a 15% reduction of volcanic emissions.

run.pl,Makefile:
- replace deprecated VolcanoesLL.dat files by columnsource_location.csv and
  columnsource_emission.csv files, to be used by ColumnSource_ml.
  Default files, $DataDir/volcano_location.csv and $DataDir/volcano_emission.csv,
  contains SO2 passive deggasing from Etna and Stromboli,
  ASH Eyjafjallajökull's 2010 eruption, and ASH and SO2 from Grimsvotn's 2011 eruption.
- 2 EMERGENCY modes: Emergency and AshInversion set from environment variable
  eEMEP. Emergency mode (default) for multy-scenario eEMEP forecasts,
  can be run by `qsub -v eEMEP=Emergency,UTC=12,NDAY=4,DATE=... run.pl`.
  AshInversion mode for unit-emission ensemble hindcast
  can be run by `qsub -v eEMEP=AshInversion,UTC=12,NDAY=2,DATE=... -J 1-8 run.pl`.

Setup_1d_ml:
- Replace calls to rcemis_volc(volc_no) and EmergencyRate(i,j) by calls to
  ColumnRate(i,j,REDUCE_VOLCANO=0.85) if VOLCANO_SR, and ColumnRate(i,j) otherwise.

Emissions_ml,EmisGet_ml:
- Remove/comment calls to deprecated functions from Volcanos_ml.

Derived_ml,ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml:
- "COLUMN:SPEC" and "COLUMN:GROUP" "MISC" types for output the column for a
  single SPEC and a GROUP of species.
  "COLUMN" "MISC" type is equivalent to "COLUMN:SPEC".
- Do not create Emis_mgm2_BioNat output for ASH_LxxByy (level xx, bin yy)
  tracers for eEMEP=AshInversion, as they total 171 species and the output is not needed.

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml,config_Outputs_EMERGENCY.nml:
- MY_OUTPUTS="INVERSION" for eEMEP=AshInversion unit-emission ensemble hourly output
- config_Outputs_EMERGENCY.nml for reduced derived output on eEMEP runs.

TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml:
- extend date conversion interfaces (to_stamp, to_date & to_idate) to accept
  dates in string format.

Makefile,mk.GenChem,ZCM_Emergency/mk.Emergency,
ZCM_EmChem09/Ash.species,Ash.reactions,
ZCM_Emergency/BiomassBurning_*_Emergency.inc,EMISSPLIT,
ZCM_Emergency/ASH_9bin.species,ASH_9bin.reactions,
ZCM_Emergency/Mastin_et_al_2009b_table3.csv,NUC_Explosion.csv,NPP_Accident.csv:
- Move eEMEP set-up from mk.GenChem into its own script (ZCM_Emergency/mk.Emergency).
- For eEMEP target Make calls ZCM_Emergency/mk.Emergency before calling mk.GenChem.
- Add of ASH_F and ASH_C tracers to EmChem09 and EmChem09soa schemes.
  In this way, there is no need for special 2010 amnd 2011 targets (eg EMEP2011)
  to include ash from
- Set Emergency scheme to be equivalent to EmChem09 and link
  BiomassBurning_*_Emergency.inc and EMISSPLIT files to EmChem09.
- New 9bin ASH tracers for eEMEP=AshInversion runs.
- Improve/correct headers on Mastin_et_al_2009b_table3.csv, NUC_Explosion.csv
  and NPP_Accident.csv files.

Emissions_ml: Added posibility to have monthly emissions in the "Mixed" EMIS_SOURCE.
Combining monthly and other emissions not tested.

GridValues_ml: lb2ij added a case when longitude >360.

NetCDF_ml: interpolate from all longitudes when only a part of the Globe is in the input grid
ModelConstants_ml, Met_ml: increased the size of some strings to allow for long pathes.

Removed an exstra space in ZCM_EmChem09ecom/EMISSPLIT/emissplit.defaults.omco
and renamed rempm25 -> remppm25, rempmco -> remppmco

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15th May  Peter  3005

Start of reorganization of Emission setup.
The new setup will use EMIS_SOURCE= 'Mixed' in config file.
Then one can define ASCII, NetCDF/fractions and NetCDF/SnapEmis formats and mix
and add those. Use of exclude/include possible for each one.
The ASCII gridXXX files must still be in the native grid (no interpolation).

New reading of gridXXX that does not use "global" arrays.
Avoids using "flat emissions".

Does not work for monthly emissions yet. Also roaddust should be included in the scheme.

Started also to define explicit path in the config file.
The idea would be to remove all linking in the run.pl, so that the program "knows"
exactely what is used (for log/reruns).

Wil need more cleanup etc.

Also included changes in readfield_cdf used in EDIII.

Should not modify results. The "old" scheme is still the default.

Modified:
EmisDef_ml.f90 Setup_1d_ml.f90 Solver.f90 ModelConstants_ml.f90 NetCDF_ml.f90
EmisGet_ml.f90 Emissions_ml.f90 config_EMEPSTD.nml

NetCDF_ml , ReadTimeCDF: can read units "years since...".

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4th May  Peter  3001-3002

Reorganization of the monthly emission setup.
To use the monthly emissions Emis_GLOB_01deg_2010_month.nc
(or Emis_GLOB_01deg_2008_month.nc) just set
$CDF_EMIS="Emis_GLOB_01deg_2010_month.nc"
in run.pl.

NB: Emis_GLOB_01deg_2010_month.nc and Emis_GLOB_01deg_2008_month.nc
do not have proper country codes (only HTAP regions).

All the MONTHLY_GRIDEMIS from ModelConstants/config files are removed.
The code find out itself whether the emissions are monthly or yearly by
checking that there are 12 records.

The new naming convention for emissions are used (lower case).

HTAP2 regions included in Country_ml.f90

The old scheme for road dust is also removed (was not in use).

The Emis_GLOB_01deg_YYYY_month.nc files were constructed from the data in
/home/mifajej/Emissions/HTAP2/YYYY/HTAP_'//trim(pollut(ipollut))//'_YYYY_01degLonLat.',month

If monthly emissions are used, one must set GRIDDED_EMIS_MONTHLY_FACTOR=F, otherwise
you double correct for monthly variations. The code will stop with a warning if you try.

Modified Country_ml, Emissions_ml, ModelConstants_ml, all config files (except outputs)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd May  Dave  3000

Introduced new MET2D system, to allow direct setting of meteorology outputs from
config_Outputs. Tested and works perfect for ustar_nwp, rh2m, u_ref, etc.
Some problems still for precipitation. Need to work out the right combination
of scaling.

The main benefit is to make it easier to set new output variables, without the
hard-coding we have so far used in Derived_ml. If it is a meteorological field
it should be possible to get it into d_2d from just the MetFields name.

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD
- added examples using new system, e.g.
 'met2d_t2m', 'MET2D', 'temperature_2m','-', 'degK', -99,  -99, F,1.0, T, 4,
- removed older ws10,SMI_deep,SMI_uppr, etc.
- BUG? Old Snow_m was found to be more like snow fraction than depth in m
  (The new met2d_snow_m gives the true depth in m.)

Derived_ml
- modified to use the new MET2D system
- some clean-up of debugging info
- typ renamed to class, since it came from f_2d%class
- SNOW renamed to XSNOW, since this was not giving the expected data

MetFields_ml
- added derivmet with type metfield, to store meteo not coming from NWP. Unlike met%
  we only need name and the pointer settings.
- added u_ref to derivmet as first example.

MosaicOutputs_ml
- some clean-up of debugging info

My_Outputs_ml
- added some of the new met2d variables to sites output

Sites_ml
- enabled setting of iz=0, to provide data from k=20 without surface correction
  (useful for e.g. coastal sites with no nocturnal depletion, or boundary
   conditions for e.g. ESX.)

Vertical interpolation of external netcdf files:
The model did not interpret correctly the vertical coordinates when
formula_terms = "ap: hyam b: hybm ps: PS p0: P0" (instead of "a: hyam ...)
This was used for Dust BC introduce in  version 2962.

Corrected vertical_interpolate in NetCDF_ml.f90

==============
rv4.7beta1 = 1st bug fix.

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09.reactions:

Bug fix:
was:
APR2015
_func_kaero(rh)              HNO3 = NO3_c        ;

now comment out, as Aer2015.reactions has more explicit methods:

*APR2015 _func_kaero(rh)              HNO3 = NO3_c        ;


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
21 April 2015 Dave 2989-2991
==============
rv4.7beta !!!!
==============

Main change: Aerosol reactions use Gerber-calculated surface area
             + very low gamma values for N2O5

For HTAP: can now output stomatal deposition


RESULTS WILL CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN USING NEW DEFAULTS!
  Older  (let's say rv4.6) results can be restored if setting
  n2o5Hydrolis='OrigRiemer' and Aero=" " in mk.GenChem

NEW: ZCM_EmChem09: Aero2015.reactions, Aero2015.species

NOTE!:
  These are now used by default by mk.GenChem - with Aero="Aero2015".
  Set to " " to switch off. (Should make Aero same as Isotopes etc., but
  lacked time....)

ChemFunctions_ml

- Two new recommended functions for gamma(N2O5):
  Gamma:0.002   (was bLow in April 2015 aero tests)
   - provides simple gixed gamma of 0.002
  SmixTen       (was bTen in April 2015 aero tests)
   - provides gamma  which depends on chemical mixture, but reduced by a factor
     of ten.

Derived_ml
- removed USTAR_NWP, Snow:

ModelConstants_ml:
- default n2o5Hydrolysis set to 'SmixTen' (=bTen in April 2015 tests)
- default CONVECTION_FACTOR set to  0.33   (=cv33 in April 2015 tests)

MosaicOutputs_ml
- enabled output of stomatal fluxes (needs STO_ prefix in DDEP_WANTED array)

mk.GenChem
- uses Aero2015 by default. SEE NOTE ABOVE

GenChem.pl
- access AERO from ModelConstants


config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml, config_BM-EECCA.nml

- moved USTAR_NWP, Snow to new OutputMisc fields
- n2o5Hydrolysis set to 'SmixTen' by default
- USE_CONVECTION set F for BM runs

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml
- added O3 and  STO_O3 to DDEP_WANTED

config_EMEPGLOB.nml
- n2o5Hydrolysis set to 'SmixTen' by default
- CONVECTION_FACTOR     = 0.33 by default

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20 April 2015  Dave 2988

ChemFunctions_ml
- Added Gamma:0.002 and Smix, SmixTen  methods for n2o5Hydrolyis - as used
  in global testing of 2982 series


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
17 April 2015  Dave 2988

Commit of tidy ups, made before a new attack on Derived outputs...

FIX: ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09.reactions
- commented out _func_HydrolysisN2O5('OrigRiemer')    Rnwater  since
  it only worked if isotopes used.

DryDep_ml
- Many debug clean-ups
  (Added mysub string for these)
  Gsto added
  K2 => KMAX_MID to help condense code
  Partial cleanup and re-format

LocalVariables
- Added StoFrac, Gsto

ModelConstants_ml
- DEBUG%RSUR replaces DEBUG_RSUR
  AERO for surface area extended to 8 (will be cut down soon)

MosaicOutputs
- Added Gsto
  Removed some unused Gns code

Rsurface_ml
- Added Gsto instead of Gns
  debug tidy-up

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16 April 2015  Alvaro 2984--2987

Nest_ml,ZD_Pollen/Pollen_ml:
- On Forecast mode, write pollen species to the pollen/restart file (*-pollen.nc)
  instead of the dump/restart files (*-dump.nc).

run.pl:
- Analysis and Forecast runs for 5+ days be runs as in hindcast mode,
  ie will use the 00UTC-D0 or 12UTC-D1 datasets.
- Forecasts will look for dump/restart files (CWF_$k-dump.nc) in the following order:
  00AN, 00FC, 00, 12AN, 12FC, 12, current-run.
- Forecasts will look for pollen/restart (CWF_$k-pollen.nc) files in the following order:
  xxAN, xxFC, xx, current-run, where xx is the met version (00 or 12).

NetCDF_ml:
- Limit printout messages to MasterProc in vertical_interpolate.

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml:
- add MY_OUTPUTS:="TRENDS@12UTC" hourly output definition

Output_hourly:
- only output at 12UTC for MY_OUTPUTS such as "TRENDS@12UTC"

Functions_ml, ZD_3DVar/B_NMC/Util_ml,
ZD_3DVar/Analysis/DA_3DVar_ml,DA_Obs_ml:
- move norm interface and and norm_* module functions from Functions_ml to Util_ml.

config_EMEPSTD.nml,config_FORECAST.nml:
- add missing come after DEBUG%IJ definition
- tidy up ExternalBICs_bc for "EVA_EU_FC"

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14 April 2015  Dave 2983

ModelConstants_ml, Met_ml, config_EMEPGLOB.nml

 - added CONVECTION_FACTOR. Values < 1.0 reduce convective fluxes from default
   value (=1)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
12-14 April 2015  Dave 2980-2982

NEW - start of easier outputs for d_2d fields. The OutputMisc field system
  lets the user add new variables directly in config_Outputs, although
  of course Unimod needs to know how to deal with the "class" and names given.
  class type now for these OutputMisc is 'USET' (user-set), will likely
  refine later.

  I have added the example USTAR_d which should give exactly the same output
  as the older USTAR_NWP from My_Derived, without the need for the code in
  My_D.  (Code is still needed in Derived to know how to deal with this class
   of output though.)

  I also added a class rct where Setup_1d_ml sets d_2d values directly
  from the rct values. (Used for comparing loss rates.)

  This will hopefully enable us to get rid of My_Derived soon :-)

New - AeroFunctions! (should have been in 2979. Updated now anyway)
- functions to calculate wet-radius (Gerber method), surface area, etc.
  now has kaero routine (which is chemistry-independent)

Chem_ml
- added cHNO3, aero_fom, etc. for aerosol calculations

ChemFunctions_ml
- HydrolysisN2O5 has  many more options for gamma factors, using functions
  from AeroFunctions
- kaero renamed xkaero, now not used.
  (Logic is that "physics" functions are kept in AeroFunctions. These know
   nothing about EMEP model chemical species or assumptions. Functions which
   need access to chemical information are kept in ChemFunctions.)

OwnDerivedTy, My_Derived, Derived
- modified to allow new OutputMisc types, and better initialisation
- plus SurfArea added in Derived - surface area of different aerosol types

ModelConstants, Setup_1d_ml, Setup_1dfields_ml
- changes to calculation of aerosol surface area
- allows rate coefficients (class RCT) to use new OutputMisc system, here
  setting d_2d directly

ModelConstants
- changes to calculation of aerosol surface area, in AERO%
- allows rate coefficients (class RCT) to use new OutputMisc system, here
- added USES%n2o5Hydrolysis
- added DEBUG%STOP_HH to enable run-stop after e.g. 1 hour.

MosaicOutputs
- better use of sub='AddMosaicMetConc:' for debugging

Unimod.f90
- added DEBUG%STOP_HH to enable run-stop after e.g. 1 hour.

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09.reactions
- use kaero(rh) from AeroFunctions.
- has fake reaction of Rnwater to allow debugging of Riemer and gamm

ZD_ESX/refman.pdf deleted. Was starting to take space, and can anyway be
  generated from script.

config_EMEPSTD, config_Outputs_EMEPSTD, config_BM-EECCA
- added USES%n2o5Hydrolysis
- added new SurfArea and 'USET'
- added DEBUG%STOP_HH to enable run-stop after e.g. 1 hour.

GenChem.pl
- add call to AeroFunctions

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4th April 2015  Dave 2979
- introduction of surface area calculations. So far not used, but intended
  as outputs.
- results so far identical to 2976

Chem_ml, Setup_1dfields, Setup_1d_ml
- adapted to provide and calculate SurfArea_m2m3 and S_m2m3

Derived_ml, config_EMEPSTD
- added SurfArea outputs

ModelConstants_ml
- Renamed AERO%diam to AERO%DpgV, added %DpgN and consistent calculation from
    DpgV to DpgN.
- Added NSD_F, etc, for surf-area

SeaSalt_ml
- Use Gerber functions to get wet-radius
  Rename diam to DpgV

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd April 2015  Dave 2976-2978
- small preparations for new aerosol system

config_EMEPGLOB.nml - NEW!
- defines settings for global runs, which typically differ from EECCA runs,
  eg PFT_MAPS, GRIDDED_MONTHLY_FACTOR
  Needs care with emissions settings! This version uses emislist.

NumberConstants - NEW (from ESX)
-  defines UNDEF_R, UNDEF_I which can be used in initialisations

OwnDataTypes
- now uses NumberConstants to get UNDEF_R, UNDEF_I

Makefiles.SRC
- added NumberConstants

ModelConstants, Emissions_ml, TimeFactors_ml, config_XXXX
- Changed USE_DEGREEDAY_FACTORS, USE_GRIDDED_MONTHLY_FACTOR to USES% system, so
  now in config

SeaSalt_ml
- uses DEBUG%SEASALT instead of DEBUG_SEASALT

Setup_1d_ml
- Added isnan test on 1st call to set_rct_rates (suggested by Peter)
- Also added cleaner debug_flag system, isnan on NO2, and removed IXADV_ + NSPEC_SHL usage

Sites_ml
- reduced outputs to MasterProc

GenChem.pl
- added safety setting of rct to zero
- removed unused Branching statements

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
31th March 2015 Alvaro, Arjo 2974,2975

run.pl:
- Use $CDF_EMIS as the file to be used for "CdfFractions",
  instead of relying on commented/uncommented sections of the script.
- Link "CdfFractions" file for MACC14 emissions.
- Small clean-up - suggest deletion of emis_, but much more needed.

Functions_ml:
- optional arguments to norm_* functions available trough norm interface:
  w: integer array of weights of the same dimension as the variable.
  reduce: logical input to calculate the norm of a variable stored on
    local/partial arrays on each PROC (call MPI_ALLREDUCE).

ZD_3DVar/DA_ml,Analysis//DA_3DVar_ml,DA_Obs_ml:
- Specific debug variables/options for 3Dvar and Obs modules.

ZD_3DVar/Makefile,Makefile.SRCS
- MPI version of optimization utility (m1qn3-mpi.f)
- Remove non-MKL blas library options

ZD_3DVar/Analysis/DA_3DVar_ml,chitox_ml,ufftw3_ml
- Avoid half<-->full complex transformations, by only using half-complex arrays
  and calculating the norm as a weighed L2 norm.
- Distinguish between eVal/eVec on the local/global (nvLoc/nvTot) spectral grid.
- Rename/move subroutine update_unobserved (DA_3DVar_ml) to chitou (chitox_ml).

ZD_3DVar/Analysis/DA_3DVar_ml,DA_Obs_ml
- Remove 4-point interpolation options.
  Only use the grid-cell that contains the observation.
- Update bias correction routines for MPI calculations (untested)
- Increase memory on optimization calls (nupdates from 4 to 20)

ZD_3DVar/B_NMC/covmat_ml:
- write correlation matrix.

ZD_3DVar/B_NMC/spectralcov_ml,stddev_ml,spectral_filter:
- Make KTRUNC a parameter in spectralcov module.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27th March 2015 Alvaro, Birthe 2972-2973

PhyChem_ml:
- comment call to gravset (included on 2968)
- uncomment ANALYSIS calls (commented on 2967)

GridValues_ml:
- Fix minor bug in Alloc_GridFields. Wrong exit condition on vertical level
  interpolation.

CheckStop_ml:
- Add integer range check (rangeI) to CheckStop interface
- Rename real range check (rangeR) on CheckStop interface

TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml:
- Declare function interfaces for swapping between different date formats as public.
  to_stamp, to_date and to_idate take a date on any supported format:
  timestamp (type), date (type) or idate (int array).
- Add interface date2file. Like date2string transforms a date (various formats)
  into a string, with additional options for looking for over previous dates
  if the file for the specific date is not found.

Derived_ml:
- On FORECAST mode select output depending on length of run (number fo days)

Unimod.f90:
- Replace hard--coded 39 length of lastptim on MPI_SEND/RECV calls,
  so additional timing IDs used for 3DVar are also sent/received.

ForestFire_ml:
- Adapt "single opening of file" feature (introduced on 2942) to work
  on FORECAST mode. New files are opened inside newFFrecord function.
- Use date2file instead of nctime2string for persistence.

ForestFire_ml, Nest_ml, :
- Use CheckNC (CheckStop_ml) instead of check (NetCDF_ml).
- Explicitly declare variables and functions used from netcdf module.
- Clean up calls to necdf procedures.

ExternalBICs_ml, config_FORECAST.nml:
- Year dependant mappings versions for MACC_EVA:
  Rename IFS_MACC_EVA mapping version to EVA_EU_AN (up to 2012),
  and add EVA_EU_FC (from 2013).
- Accept explicit mappings for MACC_ENS and MACC_EVA versions.
- Remove EnsClimRCA BICs mapping from config_FORECAST.nml, as it is never used
  on FORCAST/ANALYSIS runs.

ExternalBICs_ml, Nest_ml:
- When the BC file for a given date, look for a file from a previous date up
  to BC_DAYS old. This is used for re-runs with MACC_ENS BCs,which contain 5 days each.
  The previous implementation switched BC file after reading all records in it.

Nest_ml, config_FORECAST.nml
- Use new logical variables native_grid_3D and native_grid_BC,
  read in Nest_config namelist, to indicate if the IC/BC files are on the same
  grid/domain as the current run. This is used to skip the expensive call to
  grid2grid_coeff in init_nest.
- Use new logical variable omit_zero_write, read in Nest_config namelist,
  to indicate if constant=0.0 variables are to be skiped from output.

Nest_ml
- FORECAST no longer supersedes MODE, in order to smplify the code.
- Update filename_read_3D, filename_read_BC and filename_write from their
  respective templates within init_icbc.
- Call init_icbc on Config_Nest to ensure that the variables for IC/BC mappings
  are found.
- Set output type for all variables (Real4) in a consistent manner
  (DFtype=>Real4), instead of in each Out_netCDF call.
- Declare coordinates of sub-domain to write as public.
- Replace StopAll by CheckStop calls.

NetCDF_ml, Nest_ml:
- Rename and move max_string_length parameter in Nest_ml to max_filename_length
  in NetCDF_ml
- Set all fileName* variables (NetCDF_ml) to max_filename_length,
  to ensure that the full path/fileNames from Nest_ml are kept.

NetCDF_ml:
- Out_netCDF:
  - Ensure ncfileID_given input/output variable (introduced in 2961)
    contains the correct valid ncID when create_var_only=.true.
  - New parmeter IOU_GIVEN=-IOU_INST to indicate present(ncfileID_given).
  - Use variable iotyp_new in Out_netCDF to hold iotyp or IOU_GIVEN.
- GetCDF_modelgrid:
  - Remove duplicated output from .not.MasterProc.
- vertical_interpolate:
  - Use explicit array dimensions on Rvar (input) and Rvar_emep (output) variables.
    Previous version could exceeld variable boundaries, depending on the
    domain and NPROC.
- createnewvariable, GetCDF_modelgrid, Out_netCDF and vertical_interpolate:
  - Add crash/debug information to necdf calls trough check function (CheckNC).
  - Clean up calls to netcdf procedures.
  - Replace StopAll by CheckStop calls.

Makefile:
- Add $(SRCS.$(EXP)) to %.tar.bz2, so source code from ZD_3DVar/Make.SRCS
  is also archived.

run.pl,config_FORECAST.nml:
- Set $MAKEMODE for MACC runs based on $ENV{"PBS_JOBNAME"}.
- Always recompile model (make clean) for MACC runs.
- So not interpolate vertical leveld on meteo for MACC14 domain.
- Do not link $HDD file for MACC14 domain.
- Write full path to pollen input files into Pollen_config namelist.

ZD_Pollen/My_Pollen_ml,Pollen_const_ml,
- new version with grass & olive pollen, in addition to birch pollen.

ZCM_EmChem09/Pollen.species,Pollen.reactions:
- rename POLLEN_B specie to POLLEN_BIRTCH
- add POLLEN_OLIVE and POLEN_GRASS species
- add POLLEN group for all POLLEN_* species

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml:
- Add POLLEN (GROUP) output for MACC-ENS runs
- Add O3 output in ug/m3 for MACC-EVA runs

config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml, config_BM-EECCA.nml:
- Remove POLLEN_B (SPC) output

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml.f90, Output_hourly:
- MACC_ENS mode: output grass & olive pollen, in addition to birch pollen.
- MACC_EVA mode: use D2D_inst outputs
- MACC_NMC mode: do not output hourly

adv_vert_fourth, 4th order Bott for the vertical routine available
(but not used).
Only there for possible test in the future (not switch included).
Only small differences noticed for O3 (a few ppb), much less for SIA.

adv_vert_zero, also available, but give large differences, and may therefore
still have bugs.

17th March 2015 Peter  2964

Gridded monthly timefactors can be switched on with
USE_GRIDDED_EMIS_MONTHLY_FACTOR
in  ModelConstants_ml.f90
It uses the file ECLIPSEv5_monthly_patterns.nc and the mapping between sectors is
defined (hardcoded) in Read_monthly_emis_grid_fac in Timefactors_ml.f90

Careful with normalization:
A constant emission means a value of nmdays(month)/nydays in ECLIPSEv5_monthly_patterns.nc,
but when use as a multiplicative factor for tfac, GridTfac = 1.0 corresponds to constant
emissions.

Careful with normalization 2:
The fac_emm which normally (in case ASCII factors) are used for monthly timefactors, are now used to
renormalize the monthes, in order to correct for varying number of week-ends.

The ASCII monthly factors are overwritten, i.e. not used if
USE_GRIDDED_EMIS_MONTHLY_FACTOR=.true.

Modified:

Dust BIC is read from a Global NetCDF file. The values have been obtained with a
global run of the model.
The molwt as defined in the file is 200 g/mol.
The fields set here are defined in CM_BoundaryConditions.inc for IBC_DUST_f

11th March 2015 Peter, Riinu  2961

When writing nest BC on one single file, the model crashes after a long time
(for instance 35 days), without apparent reasons. The crash occurs when the file is attempted closing,
with the error message: "Can't open HDF5 attribute".

The time after which it crashes depends on the size of the domain and the number
of components, but it is the same if debug options are set.

No direct solution has been found. One indirect solution is to write into a
different file every month (or day).

Another indirect solution which is implemented in this revision, is to keep the
file open between each component write; this is also faster.

Modified NetCDF_ml, Nest_ml

Added

  ZCM_EmChem09ecom directory
      - has EC_OM.reactions with these new emissions
      - EMISPLIT files
      - Biomass files

  mk.GenChem has added EmChem09ecom option

WARNING:

Emissions_ml had hard-coded NC_EMIS_SPEC names, which will not work with
the new system. This needs to be altered anyway, so for now has been

(2946 was used for EuroDelta SOA. Denote as rv4.6 in Status Report 2017 Table)

Refactoring the GlobalBC_ml  and BoundaryConditions_ml.

All fulldomain arrays are removed and a lot of unnecessary buffer and indices.
GlobalBC_ml is not in use anymore; most of the content is moved into GetBICData,
but with local arrays instead of fulldomain arrays.

O3 read from Logan_P.nc, which is flexible wrt number of vertical levels.
Can slightly change O3 (<0.1 ppb?) compared to earlier versions.

DO_SAHARA removed. (DUST BC will be replaced by global values in later revision)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
11th February 2015 Peter, Dave 2937-2942

Changes in BIC, GlobalBCs_ml :

all Latitude profiles are removed! (set to 1)

Vertical profiles implemented for IBC_HCHO ,IBC_SEASALT_f,
IBC_SEASALT_C, IBC_SEASALT_G, IBC_CH3CHO, IBC_NH4_f, IBC_NO3_f
(were missing)

trend for O3 removed when Mace Head correction is applied for year 1990-1999

run.pl corrected for Inputs_Mar2013

ForestFire_ml with single opening of file. Some seconds saved, perhaps, for many
processors runs.

Write out which Mace Head correction is used in RunLog

NetCDF_ml, ReadField_CDF: ncFileID_given when the file is already open.
                          The file is not closed on exit.

EmisGet_ml: ncFileID_given=ncFileID in EmisGetCdf.
Much faster if no emissions are read (took about 0.3 seconds to open the file).
Now "all" emissions can be read in about 3 minutes (instead of 18).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
29th January  2015 Peter    2927

Completely decoupled the array index in Country_ml and the country-code used in
emission files.
This is both more logical (you now choose for instance a country code= 1000000 without problems,
giving more flexibility for systematicdefinitions)
and will save array sizes, since NLAND is now exactely equal to the number of countries.

It does not give exactely the same results, because there was some bugs in the earlier version.
(Russia?). Hopefully this only affected a timefactor or split.
Modified:
Country_ml
Unimod
Timefactors_ml
EmisGet_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27th January  2015 Peter, Jan Eiof    2926

Possibility to get total emissions after splits and including all natural
emissions. Units are mg/m2 (uses molecular weight of components, not only "N" etc.)
Put EmisSplit_OUT = .true. in My_Derived_ml.f90
For now put 18 splits (can be increased)
Modified:
Derived_ml.f90
Setup_1d_ml.f90

TimeDate_ml - added same_date and print_date routines

   (from ESX work, but generally useful I hope)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th December 2014 Peter   2921

MARS_ml.f90 in some situations the "IS_SAFE_DIV" got true (once encountered for
GLOBAL run once for MACC14). It does not happen often.
This is probably because the test is done assuming that we use real*4.
We have set our "small numbers" as 1E-30, and the actcof routine contains a
GAMA=10.0**TRM which can be as much as 1E30.
sometimes (in combination with other small numbers) this triggers the test.

Threfore I have set:
IS_SAFE_DIV: R4=.FALSE. (for the "MARS" case)
Which did not trigger IS_SAFE_DIV, at least in the GLOBAL case.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27th December 2014 Dave   2919-2920

NB: IN-PROGRESS VERSION
  Bug mentioned below is partially fixed if USES%PFT_MAPS set to true, but
  not all implications workde out yet. Also need to add SGS, EGS for crops
  which are not dealt with by PFT_MAPS. Also need to consider use of SGS in
  Biogenics_ml

  In other words, if considering global runs, THINK and CHECK!


MARS_ml (2919)
  Crashed on 23rd May 2010 global run. Now replaced CheckStop with write-out and
  exit from routine. Needs attention? (See DSMARS lines, and nMarsErrors usage)


Landuse_ml
ModelConstants
config_EMEPSTD
(Other configs will need adapting!)

  DEBUG% PFT_MAPS, LANDUSE and DO3SE now use integers. Specify 1 for basic
   debug, 2 for more verbose.

DO3SE_ml
  Added gsf scaling factor to fPhenology to account (in a crude way) for EGS-SGS < 90 days.
  Removed elemental tag to allow print out.

LandDefs_ml
   Small debug output change

Sites_ml
  Set debug_1d = .false. to avoid excessive printouts.



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
25th December 2014 Dave   2918

NB: Bug discovered in Landuse_ml: effectivdaynumber usage gives wrong
  growing seasons. Will be fixed in next days.

AOTnPOD_ml: added SpringWheat, WinterWheat PODs
DO3SE_ml: increased MAXnSumVPD
DryDep_ml: DEBUG for DRYDEP now as DEBUG%DRYDEP
LandDefs_ml: DEBUG for LandDefs_ml now as DEBUG%LANDDEFS
Landuse_ml:
   Added initial code to read growing seasons from GAEZ-CRU system, with
    VEG_2dGS, Veg_2dGSparams from config
   DEBUG for Landuse_ml now as DEBUG%LANDUSE
   Added initial code for SpringWheat, WinterWheat
   Added some extra debugs while chasing effectivdaynumber bug
ModelConstants_ml
   Moved DEBUG as decribed above
   Added VEG_2dGS, Veg_2dGSparams for config
MosaicOutputs_ml
   Added LAI as one of the MOSAIC_METCONCS array (gives e.g. LAI_GR - exposes bug very well
   near equator!)
   DEBUG for MOSAICS now as DEBUG%MOSAICS
My_Derived_ml
   Added MMC_LAI
   Added PODs for SpringWheat, WinterWheat PODs
   (should all be moved to config!)
   More MET_LCS to get LAI while chasing bug
StoFlux_ml
   DEBUG for STOFLUX now as DEBUG%STOFLUX

Emissions can be reduced according to a mask file. The mask file must be of the same
size as the native emissions (i.e. not necessarily the same as model grid).

Usage:
in ReadField_CDF the following optional variables can be set:

     Mask_fileName,Mask_varname,Mask_Code,NMask_Code,Mask_ReducFactor

  !Mask_fileName -> name of the file
  !Mask_varname -> name of the variable used for mask ,
  !Mask_Code(1:NMask_Code) -> values from the mask_value for which to apply
  !the reduction (reduction is applied if any of the Mask_Code=Mask_value)
  !NMask_Code -> size of the array Mask_Code with defined values
  !Mask_ReducFactor -> multiplicative factor for reduction where mask applies


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
22th December 2014 Alvaro  2914,2915,2917(Log.changes)

Sites_ml,NetCDF_ml:
- Rewrite siteswrt_surf, siteswrt_sondes, siteswrt_out (Sites_ml),
  Create_CDF_sondes & Out_CDF_sondes (NetCDF_ml), so the station meta-data
  can is stored on variables instead of attributes.
- Instead of using multiple arrays for attribute names and values for each
  attribute type (string/integer/real), use string arrays to hold all
  meta-data.
- Global attributes and station meta data are collected on MetaData array, and
  variables names attributes (long_name, units, _FillValue) on SpecDef array.
  MetaData and SpecDef are phrased on Create_CDF_sondes to retrieve the information.
- Special care is taken to match variables and _FilValue types.

Units_ml:
- Correct mcm2 (molec/cm2) and e15mcm2 (1e15molec/cm2) definitions.
  This units do need to be further multiplied by roa to complete the conversion.

config_BM-EECCA.nml:
Following changes on config_EMEPSTD.nml
- Remove unused DEBUG%GLOBBC and DEBUG%HOURLY_OUTPUTS
- Add USES%PFT_MAPS
- Set EMIS_OUT=F and need_poll=F

Convection_ml,Derived_ml
- Remove unused INCLUDE 'mpif.h' statement.

MassBudget_ml:
- Add comment about "use mpi" statement.
- Remove unused MPI variables.

run.pl,Makefile:
- Write svnversion to .version with `make version`,
  so run.pl has access to version number in vilje compute nodes.
- Keep linked files on BM runs
- Reduce the FORECAST/HINDCAST threshold from 10 days to 6 days for MACC-ENS/EVA.
- Increase MPI_BUFS_PER_PROC on vilje runs

Makefile:
- Use `nc-config --cflags` (only include paths)
  instead of `nc-config --fflags` (include paths and optimization options)
  to avoid possible incompatibilities with options on OPT_FLAGS or DEBUG_FLAGS
- Move -cpp $(DFLAGS) from line 15 to line 71 so they are available to all
  supporeted machines/compilers

Derived_ml:
- Use to_molec_cm3 instead of to_number_cm3 (same constant) to improve readability.

CoDep_ml,DryDep_ml,Convection_ml,OutputChem_ml,GridValues_ml,BoundaryConditions_ml,
Setup_1d_ml,DO3SE_ml,Io_Progs_ml,Volcanos_ml,EmisGet_ml,Landuse_ml,Derived_ml,
Emergency_ml,Wesely_ml,LandDefs_ml,Rsurface_ml,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml:
- Replace '/**' in comments by '***', as they cause an error for gfrtran -cpp.

CoDep_ml,BoundaryConditions_ml,DO3SE_ml,Io_Progs_ml,Volcanos_ml,
Wesely_ml,Rsurface_ml,Sites_ml:
- Remove Copyright notice as it will be added by mk.OpenSource.

Test versions of MARS. We have now:

MARS_2900 : version that we had up to now
GEOSCHEM : GEOSCHEM version. NB: this version is not continuous
MARS : Small (?) improvements compared to MARS_2900. Complete list of improvements:
1) TSO4 = MAX( FLOOR, TSO4  )
2) IF ( fRH .LT. 0.01 ) -> return original values
3) if( (TSO4 <= MINSO4 ) (instead of "<")
4) IF ( .NOT. ( IS_SAFE_DIV( GAMAS2, GAMAS1*GAMAS1*GAMAS1, R4=.TRUE. )&
                 .AND. IS_SAFE_DIV( KNA, GAMANA*GAMANA, R4=.TRUE. ) &
                 ) ) THEN
                WRITE(6,*) 'RPMARES: not safe to divide...exit'
               call CheckStop("UNDER/OVERFLOW in rpmares (MARS)")

5) IF (HPLUS <= 0d0)-> return original values
6) MHSO4 = MAX( 1.0d-10, MHSO4 )
7) if(abs(GAMANA)<FLOOR  .or. abs(GAMAS1)<FLOOR) -> return original values
8) ASO4_Low = MSO4 * WH2O * MWSO4 !pw added after [rjp, 12/12/01]
9)  after 1601      ASO4_Low = TSO4 * MWSO4    ! PW after [rjp, 12/17/01]
(8) and 9) showed no effect in a 1 month test)
10) ANH4 = NH4, GNO3 = HNO3 if((TSO4 <= MINSO4 ) .and. (TNO3 < MINNO3)), and under IF ( TNO3 <= MINNO3 )
11)removed if( XXQ > 1.0e-30 )  (introduced 2907) . NB: XXQ always <0!

One month run (June, EECCA) showed a max difference of 0.15 ug/m3 for SIA
and much less in random places.(new MARS-GEOSCHEM)

Between "new" and "old"(2900) MARS the SIA differences were less than 0.01 ug/m3 at max.

In addition small (?) change in awater in MARS_Aero_water_ml when x < 1.9999
Y2     = ( 1.0 - MFSSO4 ) / MFSSO4
(MARS_2900 use also the new version of awater)


AerosolCalls.f90 adapted for allowing "MARS_2900" and "GEOSCHEM"
config_EMEPSTD: adapted comments for AERO%EQUILIB
ModelConstants_ml: character(len=15) :: EQUILIB  (was only len=5, too small)

Netcdf_ml: sondes.nc, positive = "up"

usage of Isorropia aerosol thermodynamics code

new files:

isocom.f90
ISOFWD.f90
isorev.f90
isrpia.inc

Changes in:

AerosolCalls - cleaner interface (switches between MARS, EMEP, EQSAM, ISORROPIA
 now done here, not in RunChem)
 My... routines renamed to emep2... routines (eg emep2MARS)

Runchem_ml - now just calls  AerosolEquilib instead of My_MARS etc.

BUG and CRUDE fixes :-(

1) BUG fix:

DryDep_ml

  Vds for nitrate -  new equation from 2894 had wrong formulation.

2) CRUDE fixes for MARS

AerosolCalls

  Added FLOOR2 = 1.0e-9 #/cm3 as min conc. on input. Not nice, but with 90% of all
  crashes coming from the MARS module we need to do something.

  WILL TEST WITH SMALLER VALS to make sure this isn't too important. As noted below,
  the current codes are in-development.

MARS_ml:

  if( XXQ > 1.0e-30 ) then!CRUDE FIX
             RR2 = CC / XXQ
  else
             RR2 = 1.0e30 !CRUDEVIX
  end if
  (was just RR2 = CC / XXQ, which crashed and crashed...)

WE NEED TO DROP MARS!


CheckStop - slightly more informative ERROR message

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6th December 2014 Dave,  2906

ZD_OZONE/My_Aerosols renamed to AerosolCalls.f90 in main dirctory - no need
for "My" treatment now that the AERO stuff in the namelist makes all choices.
(By the way, that module didn't have a "private" statement. All modules should
 have that.)

One fewer "special" My file :-)

Related changed in:

 AerosolCalls - change of name, and added private for safety
 Makefile     - no need for ZD_OZONE/My_Aerosols
 Makefile.SRCS

5th December 2014  Alvaro 2902

Derived_ml:
- Explicitly set unitscale, unittxt and volunit for SHL output,
  as they are NOT supported by Units_Scale (Units_ml)
- Allow all units supported by Group_Units to be used on group_calc.
  Use needroa optional output on Group_Units to determine when to multiply
  by density

Units_ml:
- Declare explicitly when a supported unit should be treated
  as PPB class by Derived_ml (unit_map%volunit).
- Declare explicitly when a supported unit needs to be multiplied
  by the air density to complete the unit conversion (unit_map%needroa).
- Return unit_map%volunit and unit_map%needroa as optional output on
  Group_Units, Group_Scale and Units_Scale

ModelConstants_ml,Units_ml,Output_hourly:
- Rename MFAC to to_number_cm3 and move it from ModelConstants_ml to Units_ml.

19th November 2014  Dave   2894  - still v4.6gamma if needed.

NOTE: MORE CHANGES IN RESULTS!!!!

DryDep_ml.f90  - added no3nh4 ratio and usage
Wesely_ml.f90  - added CDDEP_PMfNH4 and CDDEP_LASTPM
ZCM_EmChem09/EmChenm09base.species - used CDDEP_PMfNH4 for NH4_f

Corrected bug in NH4 deposition (it was all depositing at the faster NH4NO3 rate,
 whereas (NH4)xSO4 should deposit as SO4. See no3nh4ratio in DryDep_ml
 Needed new assigment CDDEP_PMfNH4

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19th November 2014  Dave   2893  - new label v4.6gamma if needed.

NOTE: CHANGES IN RESULTS!!!!

This is the first in a series of changes that will modify results. Next
change will be bug-fix for PM deposition. Then hopefully coarse nitrate
and something with stratospheric O3, etc....


NO2 bias changed from 10 to 6 for 2008 BM. Small changes for secondary components.

Added USE_SOILNO test to see if "no2fac" should be activated.

The intention was that no2fac reduces NO2 deposition for low NO2 (< 4ppb), which
is a crude way to mimic expected soil NO emissions. However, when we have
explicit emissions, no2fac should not be used.

SO: rv4.5 series below.....

11th November 2014  Alvaro 2892

Derived_ml,ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml:
- Remove "2D implies 3D" behaviour, simplify code and streamline usage.
  Before 2888 a "3D" output request implied a "2D" request
  with the same temporal resolution.
  From 2888 "2D" and "3D" could be requested with different temporal resolutions,
  as long "2D" was requested before "3D".
  Now "2D" and "3D" need individual requests, one each.
- Add warning messages (PrintLog) for Unsupported (Not coded yet) outclass/outtyp/outdim

1412125200 seconds corresponds to 1st October 2014 01:00
but nctime2idate(ndate,1412125200) will return a date with hour=0;
because it compute seconds = 3599.99999, but these are not returned.

Superficial fix this by putting
ts%secs=nint(ts%secs) in  secs1970_to_int.

This is just correcting this particular case. Somewhere deep in the method there is still a
flaw with an improper mixing of real and int. Not nice to know that this can happen at anytime.

Probably no consequences, because we do not use "seconds since 1970" for many years.

Set USE_EtaCOORDINATES=.true. as default.
Should now work in any case.
GridValues_ml.f90: changed the setup for eta_coordinates.
Now eta_coordinates can be choosen as output, even if sigma are used in meteo.

(also the potential problem when nlevels is 20 mentioned in rv 2879 is solved.)

NetCDF_ml
  Fix minor bug on ReadField_CDF introduced on 2634:
- When a variable was not found in file (e.g. due a stallo disk hiccup)
  UnDef_local was used before definition (line 2449 Rvar=UnDef_local).
  Then, the model crashed if compiled with DEBUG=yes.
- Move UnDef_local assignment before nf90_inq_varid call.
- Restore "if(needed) STOP" behaviour lost on 2634.

run.pl:
link always to Vertical_levels.txt. This used to work only for meteo files in
new format.
removed link to GridDef.nc (nobody used it)

GridValues_ml:
Avoid reading Vertical_levels.txt if another than 20 levels are found in the meteo file.
(this might be a problem only if there are 20 levels in the meteo file, but
another number is wanted. Not likely to happen often)

Trajectory_ml: default month 16 to avoid unnecessary MPI communication

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th September 2014 Peter 2874
JUMPOVER29FEB can be set true in config file, and the 29th of February will
be jumped over. This is to be used in the case where it is not available in a
leap year (typically climate runs).
Note that this is difficult to do this in a 100% consistent way: date are
everywhere and used through TimeDate_ml libraries. For instance the number
of days in a leap year will still be 366, even if the 29th is jumped over;
therefore some diagnostics values may be wrong.
Met_ml.f90
PhyChem_ml.f90
ModelConstants_ml.f90

utils/meteoPreProc.f90 modified to allow leap years with 365 days.

Small change in NetCDF to avoid compielr error in debug mode.

.-interpolating functions should be systematically reviewed
.-cloud ice and water
.-Idiffuse Idirect can be provided for surface
.-aerosol = 0 for now
.-reflectivities must be provided (basic default from fastj used now)
.-probably much more

Emergency_ml
  - Emission definitions (erupdef) are not allocatable, so is it possible
    to have more than 2000 releases (NMAX_ERUP) without compilation issues.
  - If a timestep starts at the end of the release (END code),
    it wont be taken as part of the release.
  - Ensure that the release time is at least 1 advection time step.
  - A "1-puff" emission [Kg] can me set with D="1DT".
    For a longer release, the total emission  [Tg] can be set with D="TOTAL".
    Default behaviour is emission rate [Kg/s].

ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_SOAformation.species - TERPPeroxy removed

ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_partitoining.reactions - now HO2 and NO reactions with
    TERPperoxy set oxidant neutral (in []). (Since we don't have the
    gas-phase chemistry to do this properly.)

ESX only. Small changes to FortranTips.txt

Bug in the netcdf sites output: attributes for Sites where undefined.

In addition the sondes/sites at 31st December midnight are now written in the
previous year, instead of the next year (this was also done in the csv output).

** NEW ** AllocInit.f90 - to encourage setting of initial values when
   allocating. Almost identical to ESX.

   Added in Makefile.SRCs, but not used yet

** Debug changes. More use of config.

  Note: DEBUG_i, DEBUG_j now replaced by DEBUG%IJ array, set through config.

  BoundaryConditions - used DEBUG%IJ
  Chem_ml
  EmisGet  - had to change meaning of DEBUG (was => DEBUG_GETEMIS)
  Emissions - had to change meaning of DEBUG (was => DEBUG_EMISSIONS)
  ForestFire_ml, DEBUG%FORESTFIRE
  GridValues_ml, DEBUG%GRIDVALUES
  IoProgs_ml,    DEBUG%IOPROG
  ModelConstants_ml
  PhyChem_ml,     DEBUG%PHYCHEM, now uses DEBUG%SPEC
  Unimod,         DEBUG%MAINCODE instead of DEBUG_UNI

  config_EMEPSTD.nml - DEBUG changes

  Some code had "use DEBUG_i" which wasn't used at all:

  Derived_ml
  DryDep_ml
  Landuse_ml
  Met_ml
  SeaSalt_ml
  Setup_1d_ml

 Clean-up (incomplete!)

Bug for rho_surf in Met_ml, introduced probably (by me) 11 December 2013 (2690).
ps in still hPa instead of Pa when calculating rho_surf.
rho_surf is normally overwritten (several times!) later in the code, so this
has no effect normally.
Only case where it has consequences, is when 'ustar_nwp' is read from metdata,
which is only used for WRF metdata.

Makes NetCDF output of sites and sondes.

I tried first to define a new variable for each station/species pair, but this
 was very slow (double cpu time) and also the compression did not work well.
What I did not like when defining the stations as dimension, is that you have
 to first find which index correspond to which station; we have to live with that for now.

I was not able to use the string type in NetCDF (defining xtype = nf90_string
 gives the error message
 "Mapped access for atomic types only" when trying to write the strings with put_var)

We can add more attributes to the file, as required. This is hard coded now, and
I would recommend NOT to have the attributes too flexible, i.e. to have them as
 an input to the model. This should not be changed to much by the user, so that the attribute are a sort of standard which can be trusted by scripts.

I thought it would be relatively simple, but the code in Sites_ml got a bit messy.
Lots of small details which complicates (info available on different CPUs, surface
pressure to add, differences between species, station and global attributes etc).

I put only the meteo path (and size) as info about the grid. We do not have the name
of the grid (EECCA, TNO14..) directly availble in the model. We could add it some time.

15 April 2014  Dave  2766

 **NEW** ChemSpecs_tmp.f90

  LOTS of routines now "use" ChemSpec from here.

  wrapper for the ChemSpecs_adv etc sub-modules, to allow
  other routines to "use ChemSpecs". Previous calls such
  as use ChemSpecs_adv removed in many routines, see !CMR comments
  (This is a step towards a simpler GenChem script.)

  1) Sub array moved from LocalVariables to SubMet, to remove NLANDUSEMAX
  dependency. This module should only care about the local landuse, not
  how many there are. Change will help ESX also.

  Changes in:
    AOTnPOD_ml - now uses L not Sub. L set in Mosaics_ml
    CellMet_ml
    DryDep_ml
    Dust_ml
    GlobalBCs (Sub, Grid weren't needed anyway)
    LocalVariables_ml

  SmallUtils_ml - added num2str function to convert
  run.pl  - added more comments w.r.t. MAKEMODE
  Makefile.SRCS - added Precision_ml.f90

**NEW**

  Precision_ml - to enable use of real(kind=dp) declarations.

GridValues_ml:
  Fix error on procedure coord_check. Wrong/Unnecessary latitude coordinate range fix.
  The error propagates to functions coord_in_gridbox and coord_in_processor, giving
  wrong latitudes for emergency scenarios (Emergency_ml) with sources on the southern hemisphere.

Landuse_ml.f90 allow sumfrac up to 1.2 around poles.
run.pl: removed "ppn=16", as Stallo has now many nodes with 20 cpus too.
        removed mem=16gb for Vilje, as nodes on vilje have about 28 gb memeory
        do not stop the run.pl when natso2 not found (as it can be neglected,
                                                  and many grid don't have it)

 Complete reorganization of MeteoRead. The fields are systematically read from
the met(ix) "list".
Metvar is now integrated into MeteoRead (since everything was put there anyway).
Lot of clean up.
The weird definition of precipitation is corrected (as planend in 2010...);
Now pr is simply the precipitation (forced positive) in mm/s.

All results should be identical

NewLogan in BoundaryConditions_ml: path to Logan_P.nc, which takes into account
surface pressure (tests show better correlation than when constant surface pressure is assumed).

ZD_ESX/{AllocInit.f90,Zmet_ml.f90,ZchemData.f90}:
    Reworked the AllocInit subroutine to allow array initialisers and
    automatic reallocation when new shapes are required.  Updated ESX Zmet
    and ZchemData to rely on the new AllocInit.

ZD_ESX/My_ESX_ml.f90, ZD_EXTRA/My_ESX_ml.f90, DryDep_ml.f90, Makefile.SRCS:

Big reorgarnization of loops: the loop within PhyChem is merged with the loop in Unimod.
Now there is only one main time loop in Unimod, whith timestep=dt_advec.
numt does not exist anymore.
The routine must themself check that the time is correct for what they intend to do.
Some cleanup too.

The results should be identical as before. If not there is a bug.

9th December 2013  Peter  2688-9

Start of a reorganisation of the meteorological fields.
Introduced the "metfield" type.
This is meant to do be used for all the transformations that are done sytematically,
like the time integration.
The "normal" fields (ps, SigmaKz etc...) are still there and connected with pointers
(pointer means that basically there are 2 names for the same data: change the values
in one of the arrays, and the data is changed in the other too)

For now only time integration is done in this way (metfieldint). Metint will be removed.

The fields are hardcoded in MetFields. Please I want it like that, at least for the near future!

Bug in Met_ml introduced in 2672. KMAX not inititalized. Would probably cause
crashe if not initialized to any reasonable value.

Changes: Met_ml, MetFields_ml, PhyChem_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
9th December 2013  Peter, Birthe, Anna  2687

GridValues_ml: Check that the highest level in meteo grid is at least as high as the one in  VerticalLevels.txt.

6th December 2013  Matthias, Dave  2685


Point-source code added: implementation of NILU and other plume-rise methods,
 with Peter's spread-plume routine to assign emissions to layers

 No change in results unless USES%EMISSTACKS=T

  ** New **  PointSource_ml
  ** New **  PlumeRise_ml

The code will read coordinates and emissions from a file PointSources.txt.
Plume rise and hence effective emissions height  is calculated from the
stack parameters and meteorology, and the spread into the z-layers using
an assumed standard deviation of the emissions (=25% of the plume-rise
delta). Can work with any z-layers (no hard coding :-)

Changes in:

   Makefile.SRCS
   Emissions_ml      - USES%EMISSTACKS and USES%PlumeMethod
   ModelConstants_ml - USES%EMISSTACKS and USES%PlumeMethod
   RunChem_ml - if (USES%EMISSTACKS) call point_sources...
   Emissions_ml - if (USES%EMISSTACKS) call point_sources...
   run.pl  - links PointSources.txt file (from MyData so far)

Also:
   OwnDerived_ml - added UNDEFS, initialisation of Asc2D, and print_Asc2D

Caveats

   Currently the meteorology assumes lowest layer has 90m depth. Should in
   future also make wind-speed and dt/dz depend on z values.

   Currently emissions make use of EmisNat arrays, since this was easier
   for non SNAP emissions. Will modify.

   Need to harmonise with volcanic and emergency emissions.

Update Copyright text and Forecast/Analysis running modes.

mk.OpenSource, Copyright.txt
- Remove the need of Copyright text on *.f90 files.
  The Copyright text is kept on Copyright.txt and will be inserted to *.f90
  files by mk.OpenSource.
- For files already containg Copyright text,
  the year is updated by mk.OpenSource

Unimod.f90,Nest_ml,Nest_ml,OutputChem_ml
- Remove Copyright text from files

run.pl:
- Fix incomplete emissions path for GEMS25, MACC02 & MACC14 domains.
  Bug introduced on 2667.
- Change file name convetion for 00 and 12 UTC versions of forecast metyeorology.
  Assume that 00/12 UTC versions are kept on different direcotries.
  00/12 UTC versions are no longer distingused by 00/12 tag on file name.
- Hash variable %inml collects input files to be defined in config_emep.nml.
  This should slowly replace %ifile/linking.
  See $inml{'filename_eta'} for an usage example.
- Vertical description of External BCs used on Forecast runs defined
  by $inml{'filename_eta'} in run.pl, instead of linking the file.
- Additional model setup information written to config_emep.nml.

Unimod.f90,Nest_ml,run.pl:
- Move Forecast restart/dump dates (outdate in Nest_ml; $CWFDUMP in run.pl)
  from INPUT_PARA namelist (read by Unimod.f90)
  to Nest_config namelist (read by Nest_ml)

Nest_ml:
- Set number of forecast restart/dump records (FORECAST_NDUMP) on running time.
- New logical vaiable NMC_OUTPUT to reduce the output on restart/dump records.
  Only members of DAobs, DAunobs, PM10 and AOD groups are written out.
- FORECAST_NDUMP and NMC_OUTPUT read from Nest_config namelist.

config_FORECAST.nml:
- Port updates to config_EMEPSTD.nml
- Add NMC_OUTPUT and FORECAST_NDUMP to Nest_config.
- Set outdate (Nest_config) and filename_eta (ExternalBICs_config)
  by run.pl using hash/keys.
- Remove some unused/commented options.

ExternalBICs_ml:
- Extend char/len of filename_eta
- Fix minor error for DEBUG output.

OutputChem_ml:
- Redefine Jan_1st in Wrtchem as the first day of run.
  This variable is used to avoid writing partial results on the first
  run day that only contains 00-06 UTC data.

TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml:
- Add FFFF format tag for forecast step (fstep)

Makefile,ZD_3DVar/DA_ml,Analysis/DA_Obs_ml,B_NMC/spectralcov_ml
  minor updates

ZD_3DVar/Makefile:
- MKL path for intelcomp/13.0.1 module
- Compile/link options for all *.mod files in the same directory.
- Pass $(DEBUG) to sub-make calls

ZD_3DVar/B_NMC/Util_ml
- Add (optional) debug check to GetNCRec for fetching exact time records.

ZD_3DVar/B_NMC/covmat_ml,Unimod_B_nmc
- Rename resolution variables from dx/dy variables dxdim/dydim.
- Change default domain resolution from dx=dy=0.25 to TNO14 (dxdim=0.25;dydim=0.125).
- Check nchemNoObs>0 before allocate/read ucovmat and related variables.

ZD_3DVar/Analysis/DA_3DVar_ml
- Limit analysis increments (dx/du) to 500% (ANALYSIS_RELINC_MAX=5.0).
- Check nchemNoObs>0 before unsing ucovmat and related variables.

Flexible vertical coordinates.
If a file Vertical_levels.txt is found at run time, the defintion of the
vertical levels are read (in hybrid coordinates) and used for the run.
Link in run.pl to one of the files given in the ProgDir, or make your own

The meteorology must be defined in hybrid coordinates too
only defined so far with 37 levels:
EECCA/metdata_EC/2009_k
GLOBAL/metdata_EC/2009_k

Modified:
Met_ml.f90, GridValues_ml.f90, run.pl (and ModelConstants_ml.f90, Unimod.f90)
Added:
Vertical_levels20.txt Vertical_levels30.txt Vertical_levels34.txt Vertical_levels.txt

Pollen modules for "out of the box" compilation.

Makefile,Makefile.SRCS,ZD_Pollen/My_Pollen_ml,Pollen_ml,Pollen_const_ml
- Rename FUTURE_Pollen module files and place them on ZD_Pollen directory.
- Use "real" pollen modules (Pollen_ml,Pollen_const_ml) form MACC compilation
  target (`make MACC`). For all other compilation targets (e.g. `make EMEP`)
  use "empty" pollen module (My_Pollen_ml).

Runchem_ml,PhyChem_ml
- Call Pollen_ml functions

Output_hourly
- Reflow hr_out%type cases for surface/3d hourly output types.
- Hourly output types for Pollen_ml variables.
- CheckStop after CloseNetCDF, so the offending variable is written out
  and can be examined for debugging.

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml.f90
- Hourly AOD output on TRENDS output mode.
- Hourly pollen output on FORECAST output mode, when USE_POLLEN/DEBUG_POLLEN.
- Hourly RN222 on FORECAST output mode, when variable is found.
- Do not CheckStop on FORECAST mode when hourly output fails consistency check.
  Instead, reduce number of hourly output variables and continue.

run.pl:
  Fix given/when cases for $year ranges. Bug introduced on 2667.

utils/compinfos.py
  Add scipt for  comparison benchmark *.infov files

ESX changes:
    plotZarray - noshow option added
    ZCM_ESX_R12: GenIn.species, GenIn.reactions modified to make sure TRACER!
    and TRACER2 have applied rcemis terms. Need change to GenChem for better
    safety.

    esx_gleaf, DefPhotolysis - small changes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
11 November 2013  Alvaro 2667

run.pl:
- Simplify script/options for

  - $emisdir/$pm_emisdir using given/when cases for $GRID/$year.
  - $HDD skip cases.
- Restore '1-step-run if($dd2=0)' functionality lost on 2646.
- Cleaner config_emep.nml
  - Do not copy comments config_*.nml templates
  - Add a list of linked files in namelist style as a comment.
    This would help to introduce more input files into config_*.nml,
    and to reproduce model runs with future versions of the model.
- Reflow/rewrite partial of the SR code
  - $country_nums definition.
  - Reduction assignments using given/when cases for $pollut.
  - Add split countries/sea areas to $femisdat using given/when cases for $cc.

config_BM-EECCA.nml
  Commented line for a 1 week "Debug-Benchmark" run between Jan 1st and 8th.

config_EMEPSTD.nml
  Minor formatting changes

AOD_PM_ml
  Small bug fix on Qm_grp function (introduced on 2665)

More ESX:

   Added Zmet%Ra, using fine-scale calculation of Kz

   CM_, GenChem stuff
   Re-introduced Riemer, etc., for more realistic chemistry
   Added TRACER2 (and TRACER became TRACER1) for Jalle. Provides
   reacting species.


   Kz_ml
     - stability effects continued
     - added Zmet%Ra term, from fine-scale integration of Kz

   esx_Variables

Refactor AOD_PM_ml and clean up CM_ChemGroups_ml.

AOD_PM_ml,GenChem.pl,mk.GenChem:
- Modify GenChem.pl and *.species files to assign extinction prototype/classes
  and Wet/Dry mode to each model variable.
- AOD_GROUP is not longer explicitly defined on the *.species files,
  instead it is the collection of all model variables with a defined
  extinction class.
- The extinction classes and Wet/Dry mode are summarised on mapping file
  (CM_AerExt.inc) produced by GenChem.pl/mk.GenChem.
- Extinction prototype/classes and Wet/Dry mode are defined on AOD_PM_ml.

ZCM_EmChem09/SeaSalt.species,PMmass.species,EmChem09base.species,Dust.species,
ZCM_EmChem09soa/VBS_nonvolatile.species,
ZCM_CB04/CB04base.species,ZCM_CB05/CB05base.species,
ZCM_CRI_v2_0/CRI_v2_0base.species,CRI_v2_R5base.species,
ZCM_Emergency/NUC.species,ASH_2bin.species,ASH_7bin.species,
ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_help.species,VBS_help_Detailed.species,VBS_nonvolatile.species:
- Define extinction class (e.g. DDf) instead of the value of the
  dry mass extinction efficiency at 550 nm (e.g. 1.0 [m2/g]).
- The Wet/Dry calculation mode can be explicitly defined (e.g. DDf:Dry),
  otherwise the Wet mode is assumed.

AOD_PM_ml:
- Partial support to older model versions can be achieved by editing CM_AerExt.inc.
  If the case, the new subroutine AOD_check ensures the consistency between
  AOD_GROUP and CM_AerExt.inc.
- The functionality previously provided by function wetExtC (introduced on 2638)
  is now achieved by 2 separate functions: Qm & Qm_grp
- Private function Qm returns dry/wet mass extinction efficiencies for species
  in CM_AerExt.inc. Dry/Wet efficiencies are returned depending on the value of
  mode input parameter.
- Public function Qm_grp returns the wet extinction efficiencies
  for given a rel.hum. Dry extinction efficiencies are returned if no rel.hum.
  is provided.
- Subroutine AOD_Ext calculates AOD and Extinction coefficient.
  By default calculations are based on wet mass extinction efficiencies.
  The default behaviour is controlled by global variable EXT_MODE.
- Subroutine AOD_calc was removed as is functionality can be reproduced by
  AOD_Ext with EXT_MODE="DRY".

Units_ml:
  Remove support for ext550nm units (extinction at 550 nm).
  Conversion to ext550nm unit was based on dry mass extinction efficiencies.
  By default, AOD calculations are based wet mass extinction efficiencies,
  which change with rel.hum.
  This inconsistency makes the former ext550nm unit conversion misleading.

GenChem.pl(CM_ChemGroups_ml),Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml,Derived_ml,ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml:
  Remove INDEX_*_GROUP, GROUP_ARRAY, and unused/obsolete groups (e.g. DDEP_OXNGROUP).
  Use find_index('NAME',chemgroups%name) instead of GROUP_ARRAY.

ZD_ESX/ZCM_ESX_r12/GenIn.species,ZD_ESX/ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.species,
ZD_ESX/CM_ChemSpecs,CM_ChemRates,D_Misc/GenChem.pl:
  AOD relevant changes ported to ESX model.

ESX changes only
----------------

Major changes

  1) Photolysis system changed to get rid of hard-coded ID indices, and to
  use "Phux" algorthims, an

  GenChem.pl
  ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.reactions
  ZCM_ESX_r12/GenIn.reactions
  DefPhotolysis

  2) rcemis implemented better in esx_tester and config_esx.nml
  config and testing done for Plume1 case of Kuhn et al. AE, 1998
  EmChem09 set as standard chemical package for now

  STILL need to reconcile Fb and rcemis type entries. Will likely
  move Vd, Fb, etc. to BIC.

Minor changes:

  ChemSolver - printouts tidied
  Zmet_ml - printout removed
  LocalVariables -ZenDeg and CosZ terms added (zenith angle)
  esx_Zmet_m.f90 - printouts tidied
  esx_ZdiffSolver.f90 - printouts tidied
  D_Plotting/plotZarray - colour/linestyle change

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4 November 2013  Dave  2651

ZD_ESX changes:

 Bug-fixes in ESX chemistry codes:

  DefPhotloysis  - fixed indices, e.g. NO3. (Need to return to this.)
  ChemSolver.f90 - stop loop over k. Safer max(x, ZERO)
  esx_tester.f90 - add ChemSolver loop k explicitly. More ouput.

Extensions

  esx_GetData - changed to use esx%DataSoure text flag
  config_esx.nml - esx%DataSource = "-" or "Extern" added


Minor (mainly debug changes)

  Zmet_ml - extra output (TMP)
  Zmet_ml - extra output (TMP)

  Merge changes made to ESX versions of utility modules into their EMEP
  equivalents.

ZD_ESX:
  Replace EMEP modules duplicated in ESX with symlinks to EMEP files.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
28 October 2013  Peter, Semeena  2647

17-18 October 2013  Alvaro  2645-2646

config_EMEPSTD.nml,config_Outputs_EMEPSTD.nml:
  Formatting and clean-up and small changes to make them more gfortran friendly

config_BM-EECCA.nml:
  Single config_emep.nml file for EECCA 100x100 runs.
  Will work for any EECCA benchmark year.
  Benchmarks on other domains will need an specific config file,
  which can be created using this file as an example.

run.pl,ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml.f90:
  Single namelist file for runs (config_emep.nml).
  Benchmark runs use domain specific templates.
  For normal runs, config_emep.nml is created by combining INPUT_PARA (namelist)
  with config_$exp_name.nml and config_Outputs_$outputs.nml files.

run.pl,Unimod,Met_ml,GridValues_ml:
  * Replace INPUT.PARA file with a namelist (INPUT_PARA) on single file
    (config_emep.nml).
  * New string variable 'meteo' (Met_ml) is read in INPUT_PARA namelist.
    It contains a filename template for the met files.
  * MeteoRead, Check_Meteo_Date (Met_ml) and GridRead (GridValues_ml)
    use this variable and a date to generate the correct met filename.
  * For non forecast runs, it is not longer needed to link the met files.
    run.pl only checks existence of first and last meteo file before creating
    config_emep.nml.
  * Forecast runs still need linking of met files, as the file names follow
    a different rule. Nonetheless, the linking of met files has been
    cleaned up and simplified.
  * Parts of Met_ml and GridValues_ml have been clean up and re-formatted.

GridValues_ml:
  Small change to coord_in_gridbox and coord_in_processor,
  in order to ensure correct result for coordinates outside of the model domain.
  Error seems to appear only on 3DVar applications.

Met_ml:
  * Add optional logical variables ('needed' and 'found') to Getmeteofield.
    If present, found="variable was found"".
    If present, CheckStop(needed,...) when the variable is not found.
  * Re-write some of the variable-found logic on MeteoRead,
    in order to make the code easier to follow.

run.pl:
  * remove erroneous '$iyr_trend .. if $SR' line
  * add $MAKEMODE to 'my ($testv,...' definition line
  * Enforce $BENCHMARK{MAKEMODE} if defined
  * move special cases of $Chem, $exp_name and $testv
    for BENCHMARK and CWF runs to their respective code blocks at the
    begging of the script
  * simplify felt file handling, and remove obsolete code

GlobalBCs_ml: gfortran compliance

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
14th October 2013  Dave     2643-2644

ESX-only changes:

 New: mk.export - packages ESX into one dierctory for external users

Clean up & small changes

Makefile
  Reorganize GenChem targets and remove obsolete MACHINE configurations.

Emergency_ml
  Increase max number of events def per location (NMAX_ERUP) to 360.
  This should allow a 3 months eruptuon descroption with 6h records.

Units_ml
  Add support for "mass_ratio" units.
  Units_Scale process "kg/kg","kg kg-1","massratio","mmr" as "mass_ratio",
  and "vmr" as "mix_ratio".

Nest_ml
  Add unit support for IFZ-MOZART BC files from FZ Jülich.
  Variables ending in "vmr" (volume mix.rat.) and "mmr" (volume mix.rat.)
  have units attribute "1".

GlobalBCs_ml
  Collect macehead_O3 corrections for each year into one parameter array.

11th October 2013  Alan Briolat + Dave   2639-2640

ZD_ESX added - for ESX development work.  This should not be used in standard
EMEP work, but we are working towards an experimental version. Code will be
shared between EMEP and ESX as far as possible.

(From ESX own's subversion 202)

11th October 2013  Alvaro   2638

AOD calculations free of iadv_*/spec_* indexes:
  The previous version of AOD_PM_ml, developed specifically for EmChem09soa,
  made extensive usage of iadv_*/spec_* indexes to avoid hard-codded indexes.
  The new version gives almost identical results (diff<2.06e-5).
  I tried to cover all chem. mec., but can not be sure
  as the current implementation relies on AOD_GROUP and the variable names.

AOD_PM_ml:
  Rewrite routine avoiding iadv_*/spec_* indexes.
  Instead use the AOD_GROUP and variable names on a case statement.
  Work is still needed in order to remove explicit references to the variable
  names/indexes.

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09base.species,ZCM_EmChem09/PMmass.species,
ZCM_EmChem09soa/VBS_nonvolatile.species,
ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_help.species,ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_help_Detailed.species
ZCM_CRI_v2_0/CRI_v2_0base.species,ZCM_CRI_v2_R5/CRI_v2_R5base.species
ZCM_CB04/CB04base.species,ZCM_CB05/CB05base.species:
  The new wet extinction coefficient calculation (wetExtC function in AOD_PM_ml)
  relies on the AOD_GROUP. Therefore one must ensure that all variables
  involved belong to this GROUP.

Derived_ml:
  remove unused iadv_*/spec_* indexes

AODrh_PM_ml:
  Old version of AOD_PM_ml. Delete redundant module.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Temporary solution: the correction 2635 was not correct.

In met_derived t2_nwp(i,j,1) -> t2_nwp(i,j,nt)

In metvar, call met_derived twice, so that the fields computed in met_derived
are pointing to "now" after metvar:
    call met_derived(nr) !compute derived meteo fields used in BLPhysics
    call BLPhysics(numt)
    call met_derived(1) !compute derived meteo fields for nr=1 "now"

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
25th September 2013  Peter   2635

Bug. in metvar (Met_ml.f90), was:
   call met_derived(nr) !compute derived meteo fields
corrected to:
   call met_derived(1) !compute derived meteo fields

Because met_derived computes fields for "now" (nr=1).
This caused jumps (but within normal values) in some fields
(u_mid, v_mid, u_ref, rho_surf, ustar_nwp, invL_nwp and values derived from these)

This will change results!

KeyValueTypes - replaces KeyValues_ml

   - adds funcionality for new key-value pair with (key, float) instead of
  (key, value). Not used yet, but makes use of config easier, e.g. in ESX
  config we can now have e.g.
esx%Kz_kwargs =
  "Kza", 0.1
  "za",  0.5

followed in the relavent code by   za = KeyValue( kwargs, "za" )
etc. Very useful :-)

CRI_v2_R5 now works again, phew!

  See caveats below for limitations (BiomassBurning, BPINENE), but these
  are easily fixed (with some time).

Makefile - added proper dependencies for CRI_v2_R5. Can now type

     make CRI_v2_R5



ZCM_CRI_v2_R5:

  CRI_v2_R5base.reactions file - corrected for rcbio, Rn222 etc,

  BiomassBurning_FINN... file copied from EmChem09. Should
  really use CRI species.

  EMISPLIT/emissplit.defaults.pmxx - copied from EmChem09

  BPINENE not yet in emissions. Have commented out rcemis term for
  now, and also "BVOC" label in .species files (otherwise the
  emep model expects to find an emission fields), but if wanted
  BPINENE could be taken as a fraction of the APINENE emis.

Also:

  run.pl   $outputs added to stear which config file is used for outputs. No
           need for different outputs for all exp_names.

           + CRI changes, also to use EMISPLIT for now

NetCDF_ml: ReadTimeCDF recognise times unit 'day as %Y%m%d.%f'
(as in EnsClim BC)

NetCDF_ml:   bug in ReadField_CDF
      Ndiv=2*nint(Grid_resolution/GRIDWIDTH_M)

RESULTS CHANGE FOR HISTORICAL TREND RUNS < 2000 - tag as rv4.4.1

GlobalBCs_ml - 1) added macehead_default array

               2) Set USES%MACEHEAD_AVG = T in config to force use of
               default MH corrections.

               3) Set base-year of O3 trend to 2000, instead of 1990. Seems
               better compared to observations, Parrish et al. and forthcoming
               borders paper (with JEJ). This will change O3trends prior to
               2000.

ModelConstants_ml - Added USES%MACEHEAD_AVG = .false. to namelist variables

Log.changes    - added rv4.4 message to 2599. Probably needs a branch for the
               final release of rv4.4.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
20 June 2013  Dave 2618

Small tidy up and correction to settings:

mk.GenChem - reset to EmChem09soa default

ModelConstants_ml - debugs false

Emissions_ml.f90 -  commented out code removed

My_Derived_ml.f90 - NMOSAIC print outs commented out.

config_EMEPSTD.nml - EMIS_SOURCE set to None


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
19 June 2013  Dave 2617

emis_inputlist introduced  to read any number of netcdf emission files, as long
   as they conform to the EMEP style, e.g.  Emis:INTSHIPS:snap:8

   Has been used to combine MACC2 7km, IIASA 0.5 degree and IPCC shipping


ModelConstants_ml
  emis_inputlist  defined and in namelist

EmisGet_ml
  various debugging changes.

Emissions_ml
  loop over emis_inputlist now replaces older calls to GriddedSnap, GlobalSnap

config_EMEPSTD.nml
  examples of use of emis_inputlist added, from ECLAIRE work.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16 June 2013  Dave 2616

Emission_ml: changed unset index iem to iemCO in SnapPos printout

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15 June 2013  Dave 2614-2615

run.pl - grouped together testv, Chem, exp_name , GRID for clarity and to
  prevent common mis-matches.

ModelConstants_ml
  new config DEBUG system started, with:
   DEBUG%HOURLY_OUTPUTS
   DEBUG%BCs
  Also:
   USES%MACEHEADFIX = .true. by default

BoundaryConditions_ml
  DEBUG%BCs instead of DEBUG_BCS

ForestFire_ml.f90
   Improved monthly calculation. Still in development and testing though.

GlobalBCs_ml -  Uses USES%MACEHEADFIX  and DEBUG%GLOBBC

Unimod - removed older TEST DOY printout. That had just shown that DOY was
  okay with e.g. day_of_year(yyyy,12+1,1)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5 June 2013  Svetlana and Alvaro,   2608-12

AOD_PM_ml.f90 - hard-coding removed, MWT for PPM corrected,
some cleaning in Rh interpolation.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5 June 2013  Peter,   2607

NetCDF_ml: remove characters after "lat lon" for projection read from file.
(an invisible characater is appended by nco)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5 June 2013  Dave,   2605-2606

2606:
** NEW **
   config_Outputs_EMEPSTD  - start of new config system for My_Derived -
   now reads namelist from (currently) config_Outputs_$exp_name

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml. Much code removed, replaced by  namelist read in
    Init_My_Derived. (Will consider moving this call later.)


Also:
   run.pl - extended for some RCA settings.

2605:
SmallUtils_ml - added option first_only to find_index_c - let's user search
   for first occurence of a string (e.g. NOTSET).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4 June 2013  Alvaro, 2604

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml
- correct 1 char bug introduced on 2602.
  It caused the model to crash on the first hourly output.

Makefile
- Update vilje modules: new requirements for intel compiler 13.0.1 are
  MODULES = intelcomp/13.0.1 mpt/2.06 netcdf/4.3.0

config_EMEPSTD.nml
- restore  to full domain.
  RUNDOMAIN was wrongly set to 100x100 benchmark on 2599

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4 June 2013  Dave, 2603

de-associate...

Forest_Fire_ml.f90 - removed outer associate block, which (for unknown reasons)
  stops intel 12.0 (vilje) from compiling code. intel 13.0 works fine, but for
  now I have replaced => with simple = assignments. Shame.

  (The inner loop associate does work, as does associate in Unimod.f90. Very
   odd.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3 June 2013  Alvaro, 2602

Output_hourly,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml
- re introduce PS output on Output_hourly as part of the CF convention
  (introduced revision 2509; removed revision 2597).
  To be written out only if there is no user defined PS output
- remove PS user defined hourly output (introduced revision 2597).

ExternalBICs_ml,config_FORECAST.nml
- Rename IFS_EVA_2010 ExternalBICs_bc description%version to IFS_MACC_EVA

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml
- Rename MY_OUTPUTS EVA2010 case to MACC_EVA

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
1 June 2013  Dave, 2600-2601

Fortran 2003 "associate" introduced, and start of new config system (USES% type):

ForestFires_ml:
   USES type added, with forest-fire settings as first example
   Introduced USES%MONTHLY_FF option to force monthly-average emissions
    (very inefficient so far, called every day, but will fix later.)

ModelConstants_ml: USES type added, with forest-fire settings as first example
Setup_1d_ml: USES%FOREST_FIRES
Unimod.f90:  USES%FOREST_FIRES and associate (e.g. mm=> current_date%month)

config_EMEPSTD, EMERGENCY, FORECAST, IMPACT2C updated with new USES system.

Both of these features simplify the code and should be expanded.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
31 May 2013  Alvaro, 2595-2599 - to be released as rv4.4 open-source summer 2013

2595: Prepare code for status runs
2596: eEMEP and FORECAST downstream updates
2597: Improve hourly output
2598: Extend Nest configuration via namelist
2599: 3DVar updates

Makefile:
- make targets with Grimsvotn eruption tracers (EMEP2011 SR-EMEP2011)
- make eEMEP target with EmChem09 insead of EmChem09soa
- mk.GenChem quiet option (-q) for all GenChem targets, except EMEP and EMCHEM09
- compilation options for MACHINE=byvind

run.pl
- make and BM options for status run
- introduce MACC14 domain, and use it as default for FORECAST runs

mk.GenChem
- Emergency files created by mk.GenChem (emergency_location.csv & emergency_emission.csv)
  will be kept in ZCM_Emergency, instead of the run directory (ZCM_EmChem09soa).

Units_ml
- Fix wrong unit conversion for uBqh.

FUTURE_Pollen_ml,run.pl
- change name for pollen forecast dump/restart files

Emissions_ml,run.pl
- Remove hardcodded path to Emis_TNO7.nc
- Change name used in model from Emis_TNO7.nc to EmisFracs_TNO7.nc,
  in order to distinguish this emission format from others currently been tested.
- run.pl links EmisFracs_TNO7.nc to Emis_TNO7.nc

Output_hourly,Derived_ml,ModelConstants_ml
- rename IOU_HOUR_PREVIOUS to IOU_YEAR_LASTHH

Output_hourly,ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml
- D2D specific types _inst, _accum & _mean for instantanous, accumulated and mean
  output comparable to daily,...,yearly output.
  D2D_inst is taken from d_2d(..,IOU_INST). D2D_accum and D2D_mean are
  calculated from d_2d(..,IOU_YEAR)-d_2d(..,IOU_YEAR_LASTHH).
- Change D2D output for averaged species (f_2d(ispec)%avg).
  For such species D2D will assume that D2D_mean is required.
  In previous versions, it assumed D2D_inst.
- Hourly PS output is defined as
    hr_out(0)=Asc2D("PS","D2D_inst",find_index("PSURF",f_2d(:)%name),...
  This is to avoid the double definition in hr_out and Output_hourly

Nest_ml,config_*.nml
- Nest BC input/output frequency (NHOURREAD/NHOURSAVE)
  defined trough Nest_config namelist

ZD_3DVar/Makefile,Analysis/DA_Obs_ml,DA_3DVar_ml
- implement MATCH chisq_over_nobs2 routine for chi^2 evaluation

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
31 May 2013 Dave, 2594

Met_ml:  code for SMI now re-written to check for different options in a loop:

   ! Soil water has many names. Some we can deal with:
   ! (and all need to end up as SMI)
    character(len=*), dimension(4), parameter :: possible_soilwater_uppr = (/&
        "SMI1                " &
       ,"SMI                 " &
       ,"soil_water_content  " &
       ,"soil_wetness_surface" &
    /)
    character(len=*), dimension(3), parameter :: possible_soilwater_deep = (/&
        "SMI3                   " &
       ,"SMI                    " &
       ,"deep_soil_water_content" &
    /)

Tested for IFS, TNOxx, RCA, and EMEP (after the usual struggles with DUST,
clay, etc.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th May 2013  Dave, 2593

Makefile - EMCHEM09 option added, to use just EmChem09 chemistry.
          (We don't always need SOA!)

run.pl  - Just uses EMISPLIT specials if EmChem09  (to avoid trying to
           split PM25)
        - commented out VolcanoesLL_2010.dat line added. Should probably be
          used for all years.

Log.changes  - try to keep text within 78 chars (as in code).
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
27th May 2013  Peter, Heiko  2592

NetCD_ml: i and j defined correctly in Rotated lat lon projection
          (were in km up to now).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23 May 2013  Dave  2591

ModelConstants_ml
config_EMEPSTD.nml

  Replaced faulty Ndep_trends system with namelist-controllable
   EURO_SOILNOX_DEPSCALE in ModelConstants_ml, Biogenics_ml.
   See ModelConstants_ml for usage.
   Removed Ndep_trends code from Emissions_ml

Also, moved USE_AIRCRAFT_EMIS, USE_LIGHTNING into namelist system.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23 May 2013 Peter 2590

Added a switch MARS_RATIO_SMOOTH in MARS_ml to test without smoothinh between
different TNH4/TSO4 regimes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23 May 2013 Semeena 2589

Some formatting corrections with tex file, chapter:Subrun.tex of Manual

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23 May 2013  Semeena 2588

Added more details to the Manual.
Chapter: How to submit a run.  Details about different 'Nesting' options.

2586 and 2587 are submitted my me with the above mentioned changes in the
 chapter 'subrun.tex'.  Forgot to mention those changes here.  So 2588 is
identical to 2587 apart from this 'Log.changes' file.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
13th May 2013 Anna 2585
Deleted old versions of Manual/UserGuide files in DOCS/Manual:
running.tex, general.tex, Outputs.tex, Inputs.tex

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
13th May 2013 Anna (2584 (and 2583))
Updated files in DOCS/Manual as released with Open Source code 2565 rv 4.3:
Input.tex, Intro.tex, Manual.tex, Output.tex, references.tex, Subrun.tex

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Met_ml
Slightly different derivation of vertical wind in eta coordinates (not use in sigma coordinates)
DOCS/vert_wind.tex
Tex documentation with mathematical justification of the expression for vertical wind.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd May 2013  Peter (2581)
Added "micro g/m3" as unit in Units_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3rd May 2013  Peter (2580)
Met_ml: character *100 :: period_read=' '
It seems that gfortran can fail (runtime segmentation fault) in some cases when the variable
is not initialized  *in the declaration* (!)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd May 2013 Alvaro, Peter (2578)

Nest_ml, ExternalBICs_ml
ICBC_FMT, istart=max(istart,RUNDOMAIN(1)...)
can now put in config file to get full domain:
istart=-999,jstart=-999,iend=9999,jend=9999,

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2nd May 2013 Peter (2577)
One line had fallen out of Makefile
  LLIB := $(foreach L,$(LLIB),-L$(L) -Wl,-rpath,$(L))
Removed output comment in NetCDF
('WARNING: interpolation method may be CPU demanding' for Rotated_Spherical)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
1st May 2013 Dave (2575)
GlobalBCs_ml - changed format for SIAtrend output to fix gfortran crash
  reported  by Adam Miles.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th April 2013 Peter (2574)
Units_ml: accept ppbV as ppb
NetCDF_ml: accept 'longitude' or 'latitude' instead of 'lon' 'lat'

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th April 2013 Dave (2573)

Makefile - gstallo option added (with Steinar's help), so one can do
   make MACHINE=gstallo (on stallo). NOTE - need to do:

    module swap intel gcc/4.7.2

   before compilation. Doesn't run yet, that is for another day. There
   are plenty of warnings generated by the make though, should keep us
   busy for a while.

Also, utils/Rd_csvsondes.f90. Length of longline increased to cope with
   all-species sonde outputs (35000 chars).


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
30th April 2013 Dave (2572)

gfortran compilation needed changes in:

 EcoSystem_ml.f90 - needed trim around entries in DepEcoSystem setting

 ModelConstants_ml.f90 - removed unused variables

 SeaSalt_ml.f90 - had + & then another + (on 2 lines for rcss)

 ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml - had to have equal width entries

Not tried to run yet.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
28th April 2013 Dave (2571)

Emissions_ml - fixed call for global soil emissions for 2005, which
  was causing a crash in global runs.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
24th April 2013 Dave (2570)

Added utils/Rd_emepcdf   -  reads EMEP (or some other netcdf) files
  and outouts ascii. Can read PS or lat/long data. Good to extract data
  for plotting.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23rd April 2013 Dave (2569)

Corrected: Rd_csvsondes.f90 ;-)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
22nd April 2013 Dave (2568)

Added:

Rd_csvsondes.f90 to utils directory

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
21st April 2013 Dave  (2567)

Country_ml - added EGYP

EmisGet_ml.90 - tmp - some debugging changes

run.pl - added $MONTHLY_EMIS, which should be set to zero if
         global emissions are not monthly. ECLAIRE example added.


(all in preperation for new ECLAIRE/ECLIPSE global runs)

Emissions files (annual) for ECLAIRE 1deg created in GLOBAL. Used
if exp_name =~ /ECLAIRE/

NOTE - BUG found in some global emission files. Always check
emission output of runs!

18th Svetlana (2564)

AOD_PM_ml.f90 - corrections in v. high RH behaviour.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
17th Svetlana (2563)

AOD_PM_ml.f90 has been re-written in a flexible way,
where species indices are found by "find_index" function in Derived_ml.

AOD_PM_ml.90
Derived_ml.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
17th Dave  (2562)

BGND_CH4 added as namelost variable, to allow CH4 to be reset with
  the config file. Use of BGND_CH4 = -1 keeps default settings.

ModelConstants_ml
BoundaryConditions_ml
config_EMEPSTD.nml -  have not added yet to other configs as optional

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
17th April (2561)
Birthe - removel Pollen for user course
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 17th April  (2543)  = GP_work version

run.pl -- added die unless config_exp name (I wasted 1000s h CPU with
    a missing config file! Dangerous)

Clean-ups only, no result change. Mainly took away JAN2013, NONWP etc.

AOTnPOD_ml
BLPhysics_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 13th April  (2543)  = GP_work version
Fixed bug in Ndep_trends (now sent to all nodes)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 13th April  (2542)

Soil-NO emissions future proofed for Euro-versions anyway

Emissions_ml
  added sumEU and calcu
  Ndep_trends factor added, which compares read-in EU N emissions with
  value from 2005 GP_work. The latter is hard-coded, but this method
  allows the model to be run for e.g. 2050, without needing pre-runs
  to establish deposition fields.

Biogenic_ml
  Uses Ndep_trends to calculate soil NO (if USE_EURO_SOILNOX )

run.pl
  Removed link to 2020 Ndep fields. Just use the 2005_2009 average
  as base.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 12th April  (2541)

Changes in : a) Soil-NOx
             b) MedLAI function
             c) config_EMEPSTD

a) Better split between USE_EURO_SOILNOX and USE_GLOBAL_SOILNOX

   Biogenics_ml
   Emissions_ml
   Setup_1d_ml
   ModelConstants_ml


b) MedLAI provides Mapping Manual variation in LAI

  Landuse_ml

c) config_EMEPSTD now has
    EMIS_SOURCE           = "emislist", ! "emislist" or CdfFractions
    EMIS_TEST             = "None",  ! "None" or "CdfSnap"
  (I thought I had put these earlier. Overwrite?)

Minor tidy-ups
DryDep_ml, Derived_ml, LandDefs_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 12th April  (2540)

Pollen_ml, SeaSalt_ml, Setup_ml : Emis_BioNat changed to EMIS_BioNat,
as used in rest of code. Please be careful not to change case...

Unimod.f90  - removed unused variables from "use" list.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 11th April  (2538)

Tidy-up (more to RunLog)

ModelConstants_ml,
Unimod.f90
MassBudget

  More outputs sent to RunLog, including NML from ModelConstants
  USE_CONVECTION added to NML, default F
  (added in config_EMEPSTD, config_IMPACT2C)

  eulmod.res/IO_RES removed. Was empty except for extended Mass
   debugging. Latter now sent to IO_LOG, but could just use
   unit 6?

GlobalBCs_ml, BoundaryConditions_ml, Unimod.f90
  iyr_trend removed from subroutine calls. Use from ModelConstants_ml
  BC trends sent to PrintLog

Smaller changes:

Biogenic_ml - refs updated

DryDep_ml - print changed to write except before CheckStop

Emissions_ml - comments re soil NOx corrected

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 11th April  (2537)

GlobalBCs_ml

- soxtrend, noxtrend, nh4 trend method (based loosely upon observations
  of US emissions) modified, now with data from EPA to 2012,  then
  IIASA ECLAIRE/ECLIPSE emissions for 2030 and 2050. Fake 2200 values
  added. BCs to non-existing years interpolated.

  Results change, since previous code used 2003 values for all later
  years.

  Trends now written to RunLog

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter 10th April 2013 (2536)

Met_ml.f90:
Bug when cc3d is derived from cloudwater -> was always zero!
(not sure which metdata uses cloudwater)
put also an additional max,min for cc3d, to ensure non-negative values.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter, Dave 9th April 2013 (2535)

Bug in massbalance when eta coordinates are used (not default)
Advection_ml.f90

Derived
   SPOD enabled.

DryDep_ml
   SPOD enabled. Possibility of ascii outputs (default off)

MosaicOutputs_ml
   SPOD enabled.

Rsurface
   extra debug

New paramater in namelist for ModelConstants_ml:
 EMIS_OUT    = .false.           ! output emissions in separate files (memory demanding)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave,  3 Apr 2013 (2527)

** results change a little. Due to slighlty different coverage of
   IAM species. Also, somewhat updated DO3SE params **

New 5km landcover file (LC) used, with allowance for flexible
landcover.

Landuse_ml - reads the Landuse_PS_5km_LC.nc file to set Land_Codes
           - if a variable IAM_VEG is found, creates fake
             landcover for all veg in FLUX_VEGS array (see below)

             Hard-coded LC defns removed :-)

DO3SE_ml - modified to use Land_Codes coming from Landuse
LandDefs_ml - modified to use Land_Codes coming from Landuse

ModelConstants_ml - added new namelist item:
  FLUX_VEGS   - can be IAM_DF, or NEUR_SPRUCE etc.
  + new variable nFluxVegs which is used in Landuse_ml
    removed unused variable NVGOUT_MAX

(defaults set in config_EMEPSTD.nml, config_IMPACT2C.nml)

StoFlux - removed unneeded variables (NLanduse_DEF)

run.pl - links to new files, exclude link to older

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter, Dave 2nd April 2013 (2526)

Towards new system to define landuse codes from netcdf file, instead of predefined list.
Landuse_ml will first try to find a file 'Landuse_PS_5km_LC.nc'.
If this is found it includes all landuse with names of the form LC:CF:EMEP (where CF can be any name).
The missing data are still read from the "old" "LanduseGLC.nc" (with old names).

Dave 29 March 2013 (2525)

i) Corrected MY_OUTPUTS usage (I had forgotten to commit My_outputs_ml and Met_ml)
ii) towards more flexible landuse/DO3SE params:

ModelConstants_ml: NLANDUSEMAX increased to 30

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml: extra requets for "real" species (NEUR_SPRUCE etc.)

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs_ml:  uses MY_OUTPUTS as decribed below

LandDefs_ml - NLANDUSE_EMEP = 29  ! work-in-progress
              More flexible definition of forests (LAImax>0.5, h>5)

Met_ml - PARLAM soil water fixed as noted below

GridValues_ml, StoFlux_ml - small debug changes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave 27 March 2013 (2524)

MY_OUTPUTS variable now used in place of EXP_NAME, with new system

   EXP_NAME - should match the config file

   MY_OUTPUTS should select the appropriate data-sets in My_Outputs_ml

  - added in config_EMEPSTD, config_EMERGENCY, etc.


BUG-fix for PARLAM usage and extensions for "real" species, and re-enabled
   PARLAM runs with soil water

AOTnPOD_ml - added e.g. POD1_ACE_BEECH etc.

DO3SE_ml - longer names allowed

Met_ml - SMI now calculated for PARLAM inputs too. Reads anyway FC and PWP from IFS, as
these are used elsewhere. So, we are assuming that PARLAM gives SMI, then this can be
used with IFS  FC and PWP if needed.

SubMet_ml - sets L%fSW - BUG FIX for PARLAM usage.

GridValues_ml - small debug change

* Move NEST_MODE to Nest_ml (changes namelists also)
* Small ammend to 2518
* Small chanke to Units_Scale (Units_ml)

ModelConstants_ml,Nest_ml,config_*.nml:
  move NEST_MODE from ModelConstants_ml to MODE on Nest_ml.
  MODE is now read on Nest_config namelist (config_*.nml).

NetCDF_ml:
  redefine CheckStop(chunksizes...) on Out_netCDF.

Units_ml:
  Units_Scale regognizes "ppbv" units as "ppb".

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave   22nd Mar 2013.  (2519)

Changes for IMPACT2C and more general Out3D outputs:

   config_IMPACT2C.nl file added (needs checks on F/T options)

   Output_hourly - options to outut xn_shl added to Out3D case
     (Note: Out3D should replace all earlier use of ADVppb etc.,
      it is a much cleaner system.)
     IMPACT2C cases added as example

  My_Outputs_Ml - IMPACT2C cases added as example with O3, NO, NO2
    and HO2 output at 3m and 45m

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Alvaro 21th Mar 2013.  (2518)

* Handle chunksizes for nc4zip output explicitely.
  Fixes a bug introduced on rv4.2beta4 (4 Feb 13).
* Fix wrong file name for NEST_MODE 1, 11 & 12.
* Move char(0) fix from Nest_ml to Units_ml

NetCDF_ml:
  Additional optional parameter (chunksizes) on Out_netCDF and createnewvariable.
  When present, it sets the size of the data chunk writen by Out_netCDF
  to a variable on a compressed file.

Output_hourly:
  For 3d output, sets chunksizes for a 2d slize on Out_netCDF(create_var_only=.true.)

Nest_ml:
  Additional file_%=date2string(template_%,indate) to ensure that the
  file names are properly defined/updated.

Nest_ml,Units_ml:
  Move the invisible character (char(0)) removal intorduced on 2513
  from read_newdata_LATERAL and reset_3D (Nest_ml) to Units_Scale (Units_ml).
  Now, the full string is searched for char(0).

Nest_ml,config_EMEPSTD.nml
  Define subdomain for write (istart,jstart,iend,jend) on
  NEST_MODE 1 and 3 on Nest_config namelist.
  Other write modes write full RUNDOMAIN regardles of namelist.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave  15th Mar 2013.  (2516-2517)

  Just corrected text on location of mk.meteoPreProc for HDD files
  (has been in utils for some time now, not ZD_EXTRA)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter 15th Mar 2013.  (2513-4-5)

In Nest_ml added two times this line:
if(ichar(units(ilen:ilen))==0)units=units(1:ilen-1)!removes the last invisible character (char(0))

This is because C codes defines strings with a char(0) at the end.
It is invisible, but can makes 'ppb'=='ppb' false. This happen for
instance when units are written in a netcdf file with nco library.

Made a temporay fix so that the model does not crash when the number of vertical
levels is larger than 20:
GlobalBCs_ml.f90
DefPhotolysis_ml.f90
These routines have to be changed anyway if KMAX/=20

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter & Alvaro  14th Mar 2013.  (2511-2)

Nest_ml:
  Fix bug on read IC/BC files for variables on ug/m3 or other units that
  need air density on the unit conversion to mol/mol.
  The logical variable divbyroa was defined only on MasterProc,
  therefore the unit conversion was incomplete/wrong elsewhere.

ExternalBICs_ml,Nest_ml:
  Improve comments. Add variable and subroutine descriptions.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter  7th Mar 2013.  (2507-9)

The default is again the old (same as before 2490) method!
To use new cordinates Etdot has to been exlicitely used.
Since the value of Eta at a given altitude differ from sigma, the two methods
are not identical.

LocalVariables_ml  - just use -999 not -999.999 to avoid -1000 in prints

Mosaic_ml - added extra outputs

  older global regions - timezones should be set to -100 for US, Canada
  and quite a few other regions. Not done yet!

  Country regions EU27, EEA, XMACC2 ... defined. Used in:


EmisGet_ml, Emissions_ml - extended to allow incl and excl arrays
  which can be used to choose between global IIASA emissions or
  higher resolution cdf emissions. As cdf emissions are not yet
  enabled in the code, no effect so far, except to help produce
  EmisOutCdf ascii files which contain merge of global and INERIS/TNO
  emissions for different grids.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter 15th Feb 2013.  (2477)

NB: this will affect results a lot! (shift emissions by 2 weeks)

EmisGet_ml.f90: close netcdf (memory leak otherwise)
InterpolationRoutines_ml, new routine Averageconserved_interpolateInterpolate
Timefactors_ml: timefactor for month, new interpolation between monthes. (see also 2480).

New turning point at the middle of the period. The equation to solve is then:
1)Factor at start of month is equal average between two adjacent month
2)Factor at end of month is equal average between two adjacent month
3)Integral or average over all factors in a month is equal to monthly factor
4)The factor changes linearly from start to middle, and middle and end of the month

The value to calculate by a simple formula is then the factor at the middle of the month that gives all the wanted properties.
If we don't take into account the discretization (but we will take this into account, so the formula will get much more unreadable):

Middle = 2*Average - (End + Start)/2

Also since we need a new turning point, we will get something like "if(xday<0.5)then ...else...".

This will give some level of extrapolation, since the value at middle of the month can for example be higher than the average of all the 3  monthes (but never unreasonable values).

Dave 14th Feb 2013.  (2474)
Code added to test new netcdf emission systems.  The new emissions don't
do anything just yet except slow the code down enormously if
swtiched on (-> interpolation from 7km for many countries), but a
new routine EmisOut has been added to produce emislist-like files. Thus,
it should be possible to run the code slowly once, then use the ascii.
At least until we have speeded things up. All in testing!


ModelConstants_ml
   EMIS_SOURCE EMIS_TEST added

   EMIS_SOURCE can be emislist (default) or CdfFractions (Peter's intepolation
    from INERIS 7km).

   EMIS_TEST can be none or CdfSnap - my testing

   SEAFIX_GEA_NEEDED moved into namelist

EmisGet_ml
   Added routine EmisGetCdf to read new netcdf files. Reads all variables
   with name-prefix of Emis:  (e.g Emis:UK:snap:7). Prelim.

Emissions_ml

   With EMIS_TEST = CdfSnap, now calls EmisGetCdf (above) and
    interpolates from new netcdf emissions. Results
    stored, not used. Can be output with:

   EmisOut routine - outputs emislist-like ascii files. Works for
    current snap, CdfFrac-type and CdfSnap-type

namelist system started, changes indicated by !NML in code.


ModelConstants_ml now has routine config_ModelConstants, called from
Unimod.

The namelist file is so far called by run.pl using $exp_name, which
is EMEPSTD by default.

file config_EMEPSTD.nml added to cvs.

Code will now not work for FORECAST etc. - that will need a new namelist file,
config_EMERGENCY.nml, config_FORECAST etc.

Changes in

run.pl  - exp_name and config_$exp_name.nml added
ModelConstants_ml
Emissions_ml  (MONTHLY_EMIS now in ModelConstants)
Io_Nums_ml (now has IO_NML)
NetCDF_ml  (SELECT_LEVELS_HOURLY, now in ModelConstants)
Output_hourly  (SELECT_LEVELS_HOURLY, now in ModelConstants)
Volcanos - NEEDS CHECK. HAD Vent_found, Eruption_found tied to
  USE_EMERGENCY, but presumably even standard runs could have
  emissions? Suggest different logic, but set false for now
   (Is Vent_found used?)
My_Outputs_ml  (SELECT_LEVELS_HOURLY, now in ModelConstants)

ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml - changed output format for the Tab SOA line.

xxxxxxxx  rv4.2beta4 Alvaro & Heiko 4rd February 2013 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Small changes related to eEMEP hourly output and Forecast BC nesting.

NetCDF_ml
  For 3D output compress files, set chunk-size (nf90_def_var_chunking)
  to horizontal slices of 3D fields.
  This would allow to compress output on runs which require
  multi level hourly output, such as Forecast, eEMEP and Transphorm.

ModelConstants_ml
  Always compress NetCDF output

ZCM_Emergency/Mastin*_table3.csv:
  * Rename Mastin files (eEMEP/Erupting volcanoes).
  * Replace special characters (e.g. ���) on vent names.

Makefile:
  include *.inc files on *.tar.bz2

Nest_ml,/ZD_OZONE/*_ExternalBICs_ml
  * Move filename_read_3D, filename_read_BC & filename_write back from Nest_ml
    to My_ExternalBICs_ml.
  * Remove if(EXTERNAL_BIC_SET) before call set_extbic as it prevented all calls,
    which are needed for FORECAST runs.
  * subroutine set_extbic (My_ExternalBICs_ml) does no longer update filenames.
  * New soubrotune update_bicname(date) (My_ExternalBICs_ml) updates
    filename_read_3D, filename_read_BC & filename_write according to date,
    following respective template_filenames defined on My_ExternalBICs_ml.
  * Additional call to update_bicname on wrtxn before inquire about
    filename_write existence ensures that BC output can be splitted on
    daily or monthly files.

Update to eEMEP code. Small bug fixes and add code needed for NPP accidents.

Makefile
  eEMEP target NPP accident locations can be set with enviroment variable NPPAS.
  If NPPAS is not set, the NPP accident locations are kept.

mk.GenChem:
  * Fix bug on seed command for vent name generation, e.g.
      vent code 0103-00- to variable nameV0103A00A
  * Additional options
    -q Quiet mode. No GenChem.pl chatter.
    -N List of NPP accident locations to use on eEMEP runs.

ZCM_Emergency/NPP.*: Add NPP accident files
  NPP.csv         Pre-defined Accident locations
  NPP.species     Nuclear tracers
  NPP.reactions   Decay and emission

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml: Derived output Nuclear accident tracers
  Add commented definitions for surf, dryDep and wetDep daily output.

Volcanos_ml:
  Increase the number of active vents (erupting volcaoes).
  Previous versions could only deal wuth 5 or less vents (bug).

NetCDF_ml:
  Avoid filling out varables on creation by calling
  nf90_set_fill(NF90_NOFILL) from Out_netCDF(create_var_only=.true.)

Nest_ml:
  Runs which write IC/BC files (wrtxn) hang on creation of the file.
  This is because the a "fast" Proc may not find the file, and create it,
  and another will find that the file exist and skip the relevant code.
  Now, the MasterProc inquire if the file exist, and the result is MPI_BCAST
  to the other Procs.

  * Use for different unit conversion factors for each Ddep group member
    on Add_MosaicOutput.
  * Align/format & other house keeping

ModelConstants_ml:
  * Remove now obsolete variables SOX_INDEX, OXN_INDEX & RDN_INDEX

    The archive file contains all sources and scripts
  * MACC target use GFASv1 Forest Fires instead of FINNv1
  * eEMEP target erupting volcanoes can be set with enviroment variable VENTS.
    If VENTS is not set, the default erupting volcanoes are kept.

Updated Degreeday/HDD system - start of more general pre-processing of met data
Files added in ZD_EXTRA so far, to avoid need for yet another sub-directory.
(Could have used e.g. Aux)

New prog and script here:

ZD_EXTRA/meteoPreProc.f90   added to cvs system
ZD_EXTRA/mk.meteoPreproc    added to cvs system

   The code here does the same job as the old DegreeDayFactors, but is a bit cleaner
   Fixes also an "apparent" problem with i,j coordinates for TNO type lat/lon grids.
   (No difference in model runs, but ncview will now see the data the right way up.)

Also, more safety checks in:

NetCDF_ml.f90
        - to make sure idimID found (catches files with x,y instead of i,j).

Io_Progs_ml.f90  - now calls CheckStop if a "needed" file is missing.

Timefactors_ml.f90 - DegreeDayFactors.nc needed=true  used

Small bug fixes and settings for FORECAST(MACC)/EMERGENCY(eEMEP) modes.

GridValues_ml:
  Fix bug introduced on rv4.1.2 (Oct 8, 2012).
  Only simulations on EMEP2010 and EMERGENCY mode were affected.
  Procedure coord_check(lon,lat,fix=.true.) converted longitudes
  from the -180..180 range to 0..360 range. The opposite conversion was required.
  Current version of coord_check converts longitudes to the -180..180 range.

ModelConstants_ml:
  Since rv4rc11 (Sep 13, 2012) USE_DUST and USE_ROADDUST are .true. by default.
  Now they are .false. on FORECAST mode.

Volcanos_ml:
  Reduce DEBUG_EMERGENCY output

ForestFire_ml:
  On FORECAST mode, the forest fire file might not present.
  In which case about 550 warnings are issued every day of simulation.
  Now, Fire_Emis checks if forest fire file exists before attempting to read it.
  In FORECAST mode return it after setting burning=.false.,
  otherwise stop the simulation.

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml:
  Add daily output for ASH groups.
  They will be skipped if the groups are not found.

Alvaro/Peter (1st October)
Advection_ml: Change of algoritm; more robust advection.
              NB: The results will show differences.
          The concentrations are "renormalized" (division by p*)
              after each partial advection (x, y or z direction).
              This removes the problems
              caused by emptying an entire gridcell (extreme divergence).
              It has been tested in two cases where the old scheme failed:
          at NorthPole, and a 2km resolution run with extreme winds
              around Jan Mayen (NILU).
          The scheme was also recommended by Alain Clappier to reduce the
              "cross problem" (underestimation of advection in diagonal
              directions)
          There is some CPU penalty for using this scheme.

New rc system (almost complete). Aim is to use the rc and rcemis arrays
to cover everything. Also, all "natural" (or meteorology-driven) emissions
should be treated with the same system, storage in EmisNat.

* The arrays rcss, rcroadd, rcpol have been removed. Now we
use rcemis for all. (almost complete)

* The old "rcmisc" chemical rates are now part of the "rc" arrays

These new emissions can also be collected in the EmisNat arrays, needing
no special treatment. This array now covers all emissions which are
driven by meteorology rather than SNAP-codes. Mainly natural (BVOC,
dust, SS) but road-dust also enters here.

Status 13th. The new system works, with trivial changes in
concentrations compared to the old. I still need to fix the units
in the EmisNat arrays. Will do that before public-release - all
EmisNat should be identical in units.

This involved changes in  several routines

Biogenics_ml

Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml.f90
(Note: Only Aqueous changes usedin TSAP SR runs)

In setup_aqurates concentrations were calculated from pH then pH from concentrations.
A loop with fixed number (5) of iteration was doing this. In the original code nothing ensured convergence; i.e we could have for instance pH=4 in first iteration, pH=5.6 second iteration, then pH=3.7, pH=6.1, and pH= 3.5 at the last iteration. This is unstable, meaning that small change in start value can give large changes in end values.
The solution adopted is to take only 2 "iterations" (pH give concentration and then concentration give pH). A proper linear combination of the 2 values are taken. "proper" meaning correct to second order. In practice for good situations (smooth variations), the solution is very close to the self-consistent value, for difficult situations, the value is in the right direction, but not exactely equal to the self-consistent solution.
Still, since the method is not really iterative, the solution is stable.

Bug in BLPhysics_ml.f90/JericevicRiB_Hmix0. The indices for u and v where shifted by 4 (i.e. taking the wind from higher altitude)
This will modify results.

Experimental:
Possibility to get emissions for any grid (over Europe), based on fine resolution TNO7 emissions.
put CDF_emis=.true.
The Emis_TNO7.nc file contains:
total emission for each gridcell, each component, each sector,
the fraction of each gridcell assigned to each country code,
the corresponding country code and
the number of fractions defined for each gridcell

It is no more necessary to define the grid which is used. The grid is read from the metfile.
Also the rundomain is by default set as = fulldomain, but can still be set in ModelConstants_ml.
In future will be read in from a namelist.
To change grid it is sufficient to change $GRID in run.pl.



The reading of the gridparameters is done in GridValues_ml (was in Met_ml before).

A few small bugs corrected:
1)In Runchem setup_rcemis was called before SeaSalt_flux, WindDust and  Pollen_flux, so that the emissions ( SS_prod,DU_prod, Pollen_prod) where the old ones, or not defined at the first step.
2)In Pollen_ml the variables did not have the save attribute.
3)In Rsurface there is a L%SAI > SMALLSAI, but SAI and LAI where not set/initialized for bulk.

  Makefile*,run.pl: Only one makefile with all config for any machine.

      For convenience, MACHINE can be set once as:
        export MACHINE=stallo # on command line or ~/.bashrc
      and all subsequent calls to make (e.g. make EMEP) will use the corresponding

        were budgeted.
      - Previous versions, WetDep budget was based on SOX, OXN & RDN group output.

    - Now WetDep is budgeted for all SPCS, independent of WetDep output requirements.

xxxxxxxx rv4beta20 Alvaro      13/7/2012  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New features:
  - WDEP/GROUP output can be produced for groups with elements
    with %nitrogens/=1 in mgN or %sulphurs/=1 in mgS.
  - WDEP/GROUP output in mg, mgC and mBq (radioactive exposure).
  - WDEP is restricted to ADV species. No WDEP is allowed for SHL species.
    Note that, this was already the case for DDEP.

Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml,Derived_ml:
  Wrong WDEP/SPEC output. Bug introcuded in rv4beta14.
  Was not corrected in rv4beta16, as My_Derived_ml contains no WDEP/SPEC output.
  - Molecular wheight was accounted twice, in Define_Derived
    (Derived_ml via Units_Scale) and in Init_WetDep (Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml)
  - Remove hard codded molecular weights in Init_WetDep (Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml)
  - Units conversions for WDEP/SPEC output are handeled exclusively
    by Units_Scale (in Derived_ml.Define_Derived).
  - Units conversions for WDEP/GROUP output are handeled exclusively
    by Group_Units (in Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml.WetDep_Budget).
  - Use only the SPEC/GROUP number defined in Define_Derived (Derived_ml),
    and refer to f_2d(if2)%index in Init_WetDep & WetDep_Budget.
    Thus, eliminating the need for typ_i3 arrays tmpgroup & tmpspec.

ZD_*/My_Derived_ml:
  - WDEP specific units mgSS and mgP(?) are now obselete.
    They are replaced with mg in ZD_*/My_Derived_ml.
  - Add SO2 and HNO3 to WDEP/SPEC output in ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml
    New Benchmarks for rv4beta14 & rv4beta16 contain this additional output.

Units_ml:
  Wrong unit text for mg, mgC, mgN & mgS. Bug introcuded in rv4beta14.
  - Units written for WDEP Derived outputs were mg*/m3 instead of mg*/m2.

GenChem,MassBudget_ml,Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml,Derived_ml:
  Limit WetDep to ADV species
  - WetDep mapping uses IXADV_"SPEC" (GenChem)
  - Restrict wdeploss & ddeploss (currently not used) to NSPEC_ADV (MassBudget_ml)
  - Use IXADV indexes in AddNewDeriv (Derived_ml) for WDEP_WANTED,
    and assume f_2d(if2)%index an IXADV in Init_WetDep & WetDep_Budget (Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml)
  - totWdep is no longer calculated for hard coded groups (only SOX, OXN & RDN).
    It is assigned to the IXADV indexes in WetDep_Budget (Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml),
    just as totDdep is assigned in drydep (DryDep_ml).

Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml,Units_ml:
 Store group IXADV and unit conversion factors in special type
 - type group_umap(name,iadv,uconv) for group index & conversion factors (Units_ml).
 - function Group_Scale, based on subroutine Group_Units,
   provides group_umap output (Units_ml).
 - store wetGroupUnits in Init_WetDep for later reference in WetDep_Budget (Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml)

  Units_ml,Derived_ml (27/6/2012): Fix bug introduced on rv4beta15
    Before rv4beta15 Units_Scale (Derived_ml) provided ug/m3 conversion
    for all species. The current version of Units_Scale (Units_ml) provides
    unit conversion factors only for advected species.
     - Units_Scale calls in Derived_ml have been modified to take iadv instead of itot
     - Units_Scale will Stop if iadv is out of range.

  Derived_ml (29/6/2012): Fix bug introduced on rv4beta15
    Fix from (27/6/2012) solved the problem only for SPCS output,
    GROUP output was still wrong.
    - uggroup_calc calc gets the unit conversion factor from Group_Units (Units_ml)
    - Avoid hard codded molwt by introducing aux variables, such as
      ug_NO3_C=Units_Scale('ug', iadv_NO3_C)
    - Use d_2d(ind_pmwater,i,j,IOU_INST) instead of PM25_water_rh50(i,j)*ATWAIR/PPBINV

Dp = 3 for NO3_c (instead of 2.5)

EmisHeights.txt has 100% of SNAP2 emissions in lowest layer

("Older" (1-2 days old!) code linked to EmisHeights_rv3_9.txt)

Derived_ml, My_Derived_mk: PM25 and PM25X added. Adds a fraction
   (fracPM25) of the coarse aerosol to PMFINE. Very hard-coded for now,
    but easy to generalise later.)

     PM25  has f* NO3_c
     PM25X has f* (NO3_c + coarse EC + coarse POM)

     where f is 0.27 for Dp=3um.

  Submission of emission work.

    Hourly and HDD emissions variation clean-up. Now just read these
    from file linked through run.pl. If you want the old day/night from
    EMEP use file HourlyFacs.EMEP2003, but the best system is probably
    HourlyFacs.INERIS.

  Input/timeseries directories:

     Default EMEP and INERIS/EUROLDELTA use different files for
     various timeseries directories.  Created (in $DataDir):

       inputs_emepdefault_May2012
       inputs_eurodelta_May2012

     Choose which on in run.pl with INERIS_FACS.


  Emissions and changes:

     (i) Heating degree-day (HDD) system improved to now use simpler
     float-based HDD values. Can switch between "INERIS" and
     "EMEP" style, with INERIS_SNAP2, see comments in rv3_14_5 log.


      (The HDDxx files needed for this are currently in Dave's
       directory /home/mifads/Work/D_Emis/DegreeDay on stallo.
       These files can be generated for any meteo (I think) by
       running the code DegreeDayFactors in that directory. Run with
       -h to get options. These shouldn't be needed with default
       ModelConstants though.)


     (ii) New ourly system introduced, to use the 11x7x24
     EuroDelta HOURLY_FACS file. Should be new default. New
     system can restore older defaults using files from
     $timeseries directory.
     Arrays read from file and  stored in fac_hh24x7.

     (iii) INERIS_SNAP1 switches off the SNAP-1 year
     correction. Default false


  ModelConstants_ml - various HOURLY  settins removed. We should
   have hourly emissions as default ;-)
   Added INERIS_SNAP1, INERIS_SNAP2

  EmisDef_ml     - removed SNAP_HOURFAC (values can be obtained through
    new system with HourlyFacs.TNO2005 in run.pl)


  Emissions_ml   -

    Consistent use of hourly and degree-day data for time-factor tfac

    Better accounting for change of days with longitude:

     bug-fix for areas far from CET:
      replace: if( hour_iland > 24 ) hour_iland = 1 !DSA12
      with   : if( hour_iland > 24 ) hour_iland = hour_iland -24

     also wday (1=Monday etc) changed for local time (wday_loc)



   Timeseries_ml

     (i) Used GetCDF for HDD factors
     (ii) Added read of HOURLY-FACS into fac_hh24x7.

   Old Degree-day (with scaling-factors) code removed.
   DAY_NIGHT and day_factor code removed

   run.pl : added $INERIS_FACS, HDD stuff, new $timeseries for
    TNO and INERIS/EURODELTA3. Cleaned out old EUCAARI settings
    Note, need to specify Tbase 18 or 20 for HDD facs

  Other changes:

  Io_Progs fname added in debug output

  Met_ml - add call_msg txt, which can be used to pass messages
     to "check" subtroutine. Helps to find out which file is
     causing problems.

  Par_ml - add MSG_READ 88 (probably not needed?)

  - specific targets for 2010 run (EMEP2010 and SR-EMEP2010)
    with Eyjafj�ll volcano tracers from Emergency (-V 2bin,Eyjafj.ll)

mk.GenChem:
  - Allow -V volc option for -e EmChem09 and EmChem09soa
  - use _ASH_ as keyword for variable name in sed replacement
  - remove ISO_8859-1/UTF-8 encoding changes
  - Use capital letters on variable names for volcanic ash tracers
  - 2bin and 7bin versions for of volcanoe tracers
  - Mastin&al2009b defaults for volcano eruption

run.pl
  - New variable $MAKEMODE for specific make target, e.g. make EMEP2010.
    Replaces FORECAST specific CWFMODE. Default benchmark target is make EMEP.
  - EMEP2010 Benchmark with explicit make target ($BENCHMARK{'make'}="EMEP2010")
    and chem mechanism ($BENCHMARK{'chem'}="EmChem09soa").
    Note that pre-set compilation targets (e.g. EMEP, MACC. eEMEP) have pre-defined
    chem mechanisms. Therefore, $BENCHMARK{'chem'} most be consistent with
    $BENCHMARK{'make'}, when both hash keys are used.
  - Deal with volcanic eruption files for eEMEP and EMEP2010 runs.
    Link volcanoes.csv and copy eruptions.csv, files created from Mastin&al2009a,b by mk.GenChem,
    to working directory. Extend eruptions.csv with specific eruption details found in $EruptionDir

ZCM_Emergency/ASH*.species,ASH*.reactions
  - Include Volcanic ASH components into PM groups
  - Encapsulate _ASH_ for mk.GenChem sed replacement
  - 2bin and 7bin versions ASH_?bin.species,ASH_?bin.reactions
  - Add ASH tracers to AOD calculations. Extinction/Mass efficiency as Dust.

ZCM_Emergency/Mastin&al2009a_table3.csv,Mastin&al2009b_table3.csv:
  - Change encoding to UTF-8 (iconv -fISO_8859-1 -tUTF-8)
  - Add Mastin&al2009b defaults for volcano eruption

Setup_1dfields_ml, Setup_1d_ml, Solver, ZCM_Emergency/ASH*.reactions

Corrected (0.0 should be 33.3)

xxxxxxxx rv3_12_1 Dave, 15/4/2012 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Two main changes:

1)  Hourly .nc outputs: to allow 3-D output of both grid-centre and surface in
same file/variable. Examples set up for TOPO_TEST case.

Works for simple species only so far, no groups, but the intention
is to use Out3D to replace all the previous ADVppb, BCVug, etc... options.

Outputs appear only in Base_hour. Will add day, month, fullrun later.

2)  CB04 added into CVS. Code compiles and run. Further testing needed.


Changes:

Output_hourly   - coding for new Out3D type added, which can
     outputs values from both grid centres and the surface (3m)
     if klevel ik=0. (Uses surf_corrected logical to switch
     onm cfac when ik=0)

My_Outputs   - coding for new Out3D type added, which can
     outputs values from both grid centres and the surface (3m)
     if klevel ik=0.

     Changes include nhourly_out, nlevels_hourly now being set
     at run time (were paramaters), with currently values set
     for FORECAST, TOPO_TEST and the previous default

ModelConstants_ml - added TOPO_TEST. Partly for Emma+Jakob, partly
      to allow illustration of new Out3D options.


Other:

Dust_ml              extra debug. Found that DUSTY WET triggered in
                      Makefile debug mode, floating point stuff.

Met_ml               omit soil water stuff when USE_SOILWATER false
                     (hopefully temporary solution)

NetCDF_ml            some debugging stuff

ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml     print (FEB2012) removed

ZCM_CB05/CB05base.reactions - some tracer(?) species commented out

(Committed to save work, but needs tidy up. Will remove all code labelled
 !DSA12 at a later stage.)
 !** Be careful with this code **!

Mainly soil-moisture and dust related changes

Dust_ml - now skips calculations if water_fraction > 0.99
          debugging added for use of PWP, FC.

GridValues_ml - small debug changes

Landuse_ml    - likely coastal now looks for any land, previously had<0.95

Met_ml -
         Removed local calculation of debug_proc and coords. This has been
         done already.

         FC and PWP now processed through landify. Values over sea are -999
         but these should never be called.

         landify routine modified to use different limits. Only tested
         for FC, PWP and soil water stuff so far.

NetCDF_ml - extra debug in ReadField_CDF

xxxxxxxx rv3_11_1  Dave 4th April xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Mainly soil water associated changes, but bug-fix in USE_HOURLY Emissions done.
(WARNING ** use with non-SMI data needs further workk/thought **)

Derived_ml - added SMI_deep, SMI_uppr

Dust_ml
   Now we have soil moisture index, SMI = (SW-PWP)/(FC-PWP), hence:

      v_h2o = pwp(i,j) + SoilWater(i,j,1) * (fc(i,j)-pwp(i,j) )

Emissions_ml - bug fix on hour_iland (candidate for default method)

Met_ml

   Modified Landify in Met_ml, to cope with upper and deep soil water
   Some max/min statements.
   Extra comments
   Small tidy-ups
   ** Code ** not intended to work for non-SMI yet. Will fix another day
    Also, need to check what happens near coasts.

ModelConstants_ml - added DEBUG_LANDIFY

My_Derived_ml - add SMI_deep and SMI_uppr

My_Outputs_ml - longer text strings to enable e.g. Emis_mgm2_BioNatAPINENE

Changes to fix mass-balance problems, and simplify emissions
Code changes flagged with !DSA12 for now.(A12 = April 2012)

Biogenics_ml:   rcbio replaced by rcemis, and use of CM_EmisNat and
                EMIS_BioNat from GenChem

Derived_ml:   modified to use EMIS_BioNat from GenChem

DryDep_ml,   extra debug printout

EmisGet_ml,   extra debug printout

GenChem.pl
             Now produced CM_EmisNat.inc with biogenics
             rcbio read from GenIn.reactions  is used to flag such components

             Equations changed!
              max(xnew, ...) removed from CM_Reactions
              as change in Solver puts test on xold instead

GridValues_ml - extra debug

MassBudget_ml - routine emis_massbudget created here, from code that was in Setup_1d_ml

ModelConstants_ml - removed NSOIL_EMIS
Runchem_ml
               - uses loops of li0, li1 for now. Solved fracmass problem, but leaves zero
                 deposition on outer boundaries.
               - call setup_rcemis moved before setup_bio, so that rcemis now initialises
                 rcemis to zero, fills in with SNAP-emissions, and setup_bio adds
                 isoprene, soil-NO, etc.
               - call to  emis_massbudget_1d done after all this.
Setup_1d_ml
               - code for totem mass-budget moved to MassBudget_ml

Setup_1dfields_ml - rcbio removed

Solver_ml    - xold(n) = max( xold(n), 0.0 )  added. Avoids need for max in CM_Reactions

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09base.reactions new rcbio style:
   rcbio:C5H8                       = C5H8    ;
   rcbio:APINENE                    = APINENE ;
   rcbio:NO                         = NO ;

(rtag includes up to  RObert's beta changes below)

Nesting external boundary and initial conditions (rv3_10_7 follow up).
External BCs for IFS-MOZART on FORECAST mode. Further testing is needed...

FORECAST hourly output definition has been re-touched following up changes to
mk.GenChem Isotopes.species/.reactions (rv3_10_21)

Multy level hourly output is can not be wrtitten write in compressed netCDF-4 format.
Therefore, the FORECAST output is not compressed.

Nest_ml, My_ExternalBICs_ml:
 - Move filename_read_BC,filename_read_3D & filename_write to My_ExternalBICs_ml
 - filename_read_BC (and potentially filename_read_3D & filename_write) are
   set according to the date if the date is provided, e.g. by
     'call set_extbic(idate=date_nextfile)'.

IFSMOZ_ExternalBICs_ml.f90:
 - provide My_ExternalBICs_ml for IFS-MOZART BCs on FORECAST mode.
   For use instead of My_ExternalBICs_ml.f90.
 - 2 different IFS-MOZART BCs are pre-set:
    - IFS_MOZ_f7kn (MARS EXPVER=fkya) in use up to 2011-11-30 (GEMS, MACC).
    - IFS-MOZ_fkya (MARS EXPVER=fkya) in use since 2011-12-01 (MACC-II).
    - Selection is handled automatically based on the date.

Nest_ml:
  - wrtxn will write only variables which have at least one value /=0.0.
    This should limit the number of "unused variables" written into the FORECAST
    dump/restart files.

Makefile:
 - Compile with IFSMOZ_ExternalBICs_ml instead of My_ExternalBICs_ml for
   MACC and SR-MACC targets.
 - Change depend target so .depend is updated any time a f90 file in $(SRCS) changes.
   All f90 files in $(SRCS) are needed for depend target to be made.

NetCDF_ml,ModelConsants_ml:
 - Explicit choice of NetCDF compressed output (NETCDF_COMPRESS_OUTPUT in ModelConsants_ml)
 - No compressed output on FORECAST mode. Compressed output otherwise.

My_Outputs_ml,GenChem.pl:
 - New pointer variable for short hand reference of properties for advected species
     species_adv=>species(NSPEC_SHL+1:NSPEC_SHL+NSPEC_ADV)
 - Change on FORECAST outly output definition.
   Simulation will CheckStop variable Rn222 if not found in species_adv(:)%name.

run.pl:
 - Use username variables (e.g. $ALVARO) explicitly mark data outside $DataDir.
 - Pattern for forecast & analysis IFS-MOZART BC files
 - Link BC vertical description file for FORECAST runs.

Bug fix for Road Dust emissions in - Emissions_ml.f90

Emissions now at least seem to be of the correct order of magnitude... ;-)
Still not soil moisture "climate-correction" included.

Alvaro:

Improve mk.GenChmem & Makefile command line options

mk.GenChem: has now Help/Usage (-h) & Verbose (-v) command line options.
  * Help (-h) output contains the currently set values.
  * Verbose (-v) output shows how the command options are processed.
  * $extras can be emptied from the command line with -e 'none'.
  * Check run (-r) input so the corresponding directory has to exist.
  * Check extras (-e) input so the corresponding .species file has to exist.

Makefile: SR-EMEP & SR-MACC targets now use mk.GenChem -e 'none'

xxxxxxxx rv3_10_27  Robert/Alvaro, 14/3/2012 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Robert 13th Mar 2012:

A few more bugs removed in the road dust module from the rv3_10_26_beta
version (see below). Still NOT finished or tested!
So keep USE_ROADDUST=.false. !

Alvaro 13th Mar 2012:

Expand mk.GenChmem & Makefile for standard EMEP/MACC setup from command line.

The following command lines are now possible:
  make modules  # check modules/versions loaded for standard EMEP/MACC make
  make EMEP     # EMEP mk.GenChmem call, link and make
  make MACC     # MACC mk.GenChmem call, link and make
# EMEP GenChmem standard setup assumed in Makefile
  make EMEP-GenChem-EmChem09soa
  mk.GenChmem -r EmChem09soa -e SeaSalt,Dust,Isotopes -f FINNv1
# MACC GenChmem standard setup assumed in Makefile
  make MACC-GenChem-EmChem09soa
  mk.GenChmem -r EmChem09soa -e SeaSalt,Dust,Isotopes -f GFED

mk.GenChem - options for $run, $extras & $ffires from command line.
             Command line options are -r $run -e $extras -f $ffires

Makefile   - add 'EMEP' & 'MACC' compilation targets for standard setup.
           - add 'SR-EMEP' & 'SR-MACC' compilation targets for SR setup,
             i.e. no extras in mk.GenChmem  (-e "").
           - add 'module' compilation tag. It checks if certain modules/versions
             are loaded before EMEP & MACC targets. The modules/versions are
               intel-compiler/11.1 openmpi/1.4 netcdf/4.1.1

Started implementing a test version of the TNO Road dust emissions.
NOTE! The new routine is not yet tested properly (some bug(s) probably
remains to be removed). The "climatological" factor (based on average
soil water) is not yet included!

So for standard use USE_ROADDUST should be kept .false. !

Another update:
Added possibility to use SNAP-dependent hourly emission variations (the
factors taken from the EuroDelta-project) - not checked in detail yet
(so may contain bugs).
To use/test this set:   USE_HOURLY_EMISVAR = .true. in ModelConstants_ml.f90

Other changes/updates:
Country_ml   - added country code 93 for Russian Federation in ext EMEP domain
EmisDef_ml   - added SNAP_HOURFAC(24,NSECTORS) containing hourly scaling factors for SNAP-sector emissions
             - Started to add Road Dust parameters (likely to be updated/changed)
EmisGet_ml   - added routine for reading road dust emission potentials RoadDustGet (likely to be updated/changed)
Emissions_ml - Started to add Road Dust parameters (likely to be updated/changed)
ModelConstants_ml  - added USE_HOURLY_EMISVAR (for hourly variation of SNAP-sector emissions)
                   - USE_ROADDUST [to be kept .false. until bugs fixed!] (for turning on/off the TNO road dust emissions)
Setup_1d_ml  - adding road dust emissions (rcroadd)
ZCM_EmChem09/Dust.species   - added fine and coarse road dust species:
                              DUST_ROAD_F and DUST_ROAD_C
ZCM_EmChem09/Dust.reactions - added fine and coarse road dust emissions

GenChem- changes to allow easier use or exclusion of seasalt, dust,
   pollen, isotopes - ie the inert stuff that can be used by any
   chemical mechanism:

mk.GenChem

   Use of "extras" array extended to Isotopes, and to Boundary conditions
   (new "bics" array), so we have:

 ZCM_EmChem09: (added)

   Isotopes.species
   Isotopes.reactions

   EmChem09base.BoundaryConditions
   SeaSalt.BoundaryConditions
   Dust.BoundaryConditions

 ZCM_CB05:

   CB05.BoundaryConditions (was SAFE....)

  - these are called in as appropriate by mk.GenChem, and can be used
   from other chemical schemes

   - also changed APIN, BPIN to APINENE, BPINENE - simplifies emis output

Added:  ZCM_CRI_v2_R5/CRI_v2_R5.BoundaryConditions

 ** Deleted:

   ZCM_EmChem09/SAFE.CM_BoundaryConditions.inc
   ZCM_EmChem09soa/SAFE.CM_BoundaryConditions.inc
   ZCM_CB05/SAFE.CM_BoundaryConditions.inc
   ZCM_CRI_v2_R5/SAFE.CM_BoundaryConditions.inc


GenChem.pl - formatting in print_emisstuff adjusted to give same
   number of characters in CM_EmisSpec.inc and CM_EmisFiles.inc

DustProd_ml - uses find_index instead of hard-coded DUST_WB_F

Pollen_ml - Use of Pollen_b commented out. Thought I had done this earlier.

SeaSalt_ml -  use of SS_GROUP replaced by search for "SEASALT_" in names.
   Needed to allow runs without SeaSalt.species

ZD_OZONE/My_Aerosols - StopAll added in case of EQSAM, until we sort
   out SEASALT usage

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs  -  Fake hr_out(06) added to avoid hard-coded Rb222
   index. This whole module should be removed....

NB:needs special attention to be used (i.e. set .true.) until newer libraries are installed!
Will not work well by default on Stallo because of library bugs (the code may crash).
Until this is fixed, you must compile with netcdf/4.1.3 and link and run with compiler 12.1.2

Pollen_ml.f90 - The heatsum is calculated every metstep, and the birch forest

Removed huges arrays from BoundaryConditions_ml. They were not necessary
and made the code explode for large grids.  Later the BC routines should
be merged with Nest_ml; this is not finished yet, but has to wait.

Should be faster too.

xxxxxxxx rv3_10_16 Peter 9th Feb  2012  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The landuse must be defined before the metread (it was not).
Moved SetLandUse() before the met calls.

Moved call to InitLanduse() into SetLandUse()

Default value of nwp_sea(i,j) is set in InitLanduse, and overwritten by MetModel_LandUse if found.

Corrected a bug introduced in rv3_10_15 in RunChem (limax->li1)

The changes in rv3_10_15/16 will also change results, because it was wrong before:
If the landuse etc. are not defined in the outer frame, some routines (smoosp, extendarea) will use wrong data.
(The largest change are in the first day)

Many changes in loops: replaced almost all "li0,li1" into "1,limax".
The idea is that we always compute for the whole domain, the exceptions are that we don't want do update the concentrations in xn_adv (and possibly in budgets).
Some small differences very close to the boundaries, I think they may come from the "landify"

moved everything which was in the "my_first_call" in SetLandUse, over to the InitLanduse subroutine. It seems more logical, and was necessary to get before the BC update.
(where landsea_nwp must be set for SeaSalt).
This also changed other concentrations I noticed: because "landify" uses "likely_coastal" which was not yet set before the first call to metdata.

Also commented out the link to rough.dat in run.pl: don't use it by default, as it is probably wrong anyway: it was wrong in EECCA, and is not defined for IFS anyway.

mk.GenChem   - simplified:
               added an array extras=( SeaSalt Dust Pollen )
               which can be used by all other schemes.
              (Also, Pollen isn't yet a default species, and
               none of these needed in SR runs for example. Now
               easily skipped using mk.GenChem)

Pollen_ml    - removed hard-coded Pollen_b, used ipoll and find_index
                 instead.

ZCM_CRI_v2_R5   - emissplit files added, from rv3_9_34chem_cri. Probably
need to edit the PM ones, but just added for now.

ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.species removed --- they haven't been used for

Simplified EmChem09soa scheme.
   Removed many unused species and changed some component names.
   Reduced the level of detail for the stored ASOA and BSOA species;
   now only keep track of ASOA and BSOA (and not subgroups of these)
   [further reduction is possible to only store SOA (=ASOA+BSOA)].

The updated code should give close to identical results to the earlier version but note that to use the "research" version of the VBS-SOA scheme some editing of ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml.f90 is necessary.

The new code is significantly faster than the old one (almost 20% in the first tests).

Start of modified system for nesting external boundary and initial conditions.
Needed because we want to avoid chemistry-specific  (eg EmChem09) indices
in the main code, and to make it explicit to users that the BIC mapping
is very dependent on chem scheme and external data.

Nest_ml
          "chemistry"-dependent bits removed, functionality now
          through new files given below. Code much shorter
          since species mapping moved to external files, and
          some repetition of the same procedures unified.
          Now only needs NSPEC_ADV from GenSpecs_adv_ml.
          "print" changed to write.
          Prefix "Nest:" added to many write-outs, to make it easier to
          search log files.

Makefile.SRCS - add My_ExternalBICs_ml.f90

*** New:

File: ZD_OZONE/My_ExternalBICs_ml.f90  - a do-nothing file  for the usual case
        where the model uses the standard BICs. Copied along with other My* files

Directory: ZD_EXTRA
File: MOZART_EmChem09_ExternalBICs_ml.f90
File: README.txt - explains usage

The MOZART file is intended as a starter, but includes I think the same
functionality as the code in the previous Nest_ml. *NOT TESTED* except
for compilation (as ds has never used Nest_ml, and hence has nothing to
test with). If more complication is desired, then this can be done
within this module I hope, simply "use"-ing other modules to grab'
any needed information (such as date).


To-Do: *test* and update MOZART .f90
       * clean-up* Nest_ml, much code now commented out
        Should also make files for RCA, HTAP as appropriate. These will also
        be put in ZD_EXTRA

Dave, 20th Dec.
Bug-fix, but luckily they cancelled out
The 1st bug was that L%is_crop wasn't set
The 2nd bug was that L%is_crop was used for all gases, not just NH3

the net effect was that the intended setting of Rsur to high values for
NH3 over crops never happened.

Submited fix now sets NO

  ModelConstants_ml:
   NO_CROPNH3DEP      = .false.   - set false now to keep same results

PMwater outputs PM25_water_rh50 for surface level and PM25_water form model mid-levels.
The new hourly output type PMwaterSRF will provide PM25_water_rh50 regardless
of the level selected.


SeaSalt_ml
   - reduced assumed salt and hence emissions over Baltic sea

EMISPSLIT - new emissplit.specials.pm25 and defaults.pmco

The pmco is kept simple, and no attempt is made to produce a specials
file for that.

The pm25 is calculated from IIASA's EC, OC - as sent earlier
to Agnes/Svetlana. I have used OM=1.25*OC (which is consistent
with the SOA scheme assumption that POM is CH3-like. When this
exceeds 99%, I rescale (at least 1% other is then enforced.) See
~mifads/D_Emis/EmisSplitNov2010/PM_EMISSPLITS_RESCALING/mkp.EmisSplit

The effect should be to increase SOA a little, since OA condensation
is proportional to the avaialble mass of OM.

My_Derived_ml - set some OM outputs to monthly (M) instead if
   daily, to reduce file size

ModelConsants
    USE_DUST set .false.
    comments to discourage use of Ln95, SOILNH3

ZCM_EmChem09, ZCM_EmChem09soa:
      SEASALT_G removed from SAFE_CM.Boundar..

Sea salt is back to 2-size fractions representation, fine and coarse.
In Aero_Vd_ml: fine MMD is the same for as for all aerosols,
introduced coarse MMD = 4um for sea salt (dry dep. as SSc in SeaSalt.species)
Annual mean bias is 2% for 2009 (-12% to 14% seasonally)

xxxxxxxx rv3_9_20landify  Dave 21st Nov 2011  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ModelConstants_ml, Met_ml.f90 - "landify"

  if LANDIFY_MET = .false. , no change
  if LANDIFY_MET = .true. ,  then meteorology for coastal sites (where
   NWP_sea is true, but land exists) is created from neighboring
   land grid-squares.  Improves model performance for some coastal
   sites a lot with PARLAM met. Seems to have less effect for IFS
   but checking continues.


mk.GenChem - ammended with if-test for $run. Saves having to
  uncomment spcs and rcns each time.

My_Derived_ml
   - now copes with missing groups
   ***  removed from ZD_VBS ****  (SOA groups can be kept in the
    ZD_OZONE versions anyway now.)

EmisGet_ml - more helpful error message for EmisSplit

run.pl - lines for 2009 added

SubMet_ml - use of LANDIFY

xxxxxxxx rv3_9_20soa, Dave  20th Nov 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Main changes:

1) SOA ZCM_EmChem09soa directory added. Use when VBS wanted for policy runs

2) Stopped dry-dep of NH3 over growing crops

3) Also,Vds(N) = 3*vds(S), not 2

4) Derived and My_Derived. Started process to simplify, but needs
   more work. For now....

4a) ZD_VBS/My_Derived and ZD_OZONE/My_Derived now identical. Will merge
into one soon.  Note that now it is okay to ask for things that will
not be found, so we can ask for SOA, but will only get it if present.

mk.GenChem modified for above directory

GenChem.pl now allows emission names of lengt 30, not 12

EmisGet - removed need for emissplit.specials.voc if FOREST_FIRES used

Rsurface_ml - very high Rsur for NH3 over crops (when LAI > 0.1)

Biogenics_ml - commented out some USE_SOILNH3 lines.

ISSUES? Just check Weidinm. for OMbb assumption,also ACET?

xxxxxxxx rv3_9_20ff, Dave  20th Nov 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ForestFires_ml -

  .... continued work with the  new forest-fires routine

 --  re-arranged to avoid older use of snapemis and to
 just work directly with rcemis.

New include files:

 ZCM_EmChem09/BiomassBuring_FINNv1_toEmChem09
 ZCM_EmChem09/BiomassBuring_FINNv1_toEmChem09

 ... which mk.GenChem copies to CM_BBtoEmChem09.

mk.GenChem - copies BiomassBurning files as noted above

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml -added PPM25_FIRE

xxxxxxxx rv3_9_20, Dave  20th Nov 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Soil NO emissions added  (working version for EECCA/EMEP)

Soil NH3 "placeholder" emissions added. Do not use!!!!
      (but arrays exist in case anybody wants to experiment)


SOIL NOx ISSUES -

This versions works for European soil-NO emissions, but work still
needed on a few issues for e.g. global usage, or NH3

    (1) Soil-NO needs maps of annual N-deposition. Temporary 1-year average
        set now. Need to make proper system, e.g. with 5-year avg.
        Also need to consider "trends" for future scenarios

        Currently map is in hard-coded mifads directory. Will move to mifapw
        when procedure files.

    (2) Can now have either the hourly calculations or the monthly
        global fields. Ideal is probably hourly for Europe and
        monthly outside.

    (3) Not sure the global soil works, since now rcbio is used
        check

    (4) NH3 should be in reactions too?


Biogenic_ml -  soil emissions added here

Derived_ml - has USE_SOILNOX, USE_SOILNH3 etc.

Emissions_ml - Reads map of Annual N-deposition, or if USE_GLOBAL_SOILNOX
      reads global soil NO as before. (Will move all to Biogenics in
      another step.)

PhyChem_ml  added call Set_SoilNOx(I)
RunChem_ml - added rcbio, BIO_SOILNO
Setup_1d_ml - sets rcemis for soils only if USE_GLOBAL_SOILNOX
    (was if USE_SOILNOX)
Solver_ml - BIO_SOILNO

ZCM_EmChem09/EmChem09base.reactions - added rcbio(BIO_SOILNO,k)
ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml - added Emis_mgm2_SoilNNNN possibilities

Misc:

  Dust_ml - printout testing of dry_period

ForestFire emissions from "FINN":
http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/Data/fire/

Put new files in DataDir (Global, 2002 to March 2011, 0.1 degrees res).
NB: these files are produced with netcdf compression (needs netcdf version 4 to be read)

Modified:
ForestFire_ml
run.pl
(SubMet_ml)

xxxxxxxx rv3_9_18, Peter 17th Nov 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Use new version of NetCDF
Change Makefile and Makefile_stallo
Some cleaning of makefiles also.

Remember to do a make clean or make depend.

Note: this version links to the dynamic library (.so , i.e. is linked at runtime). (The static 4.1.1
library (.a) on Stallo is broken now.)
The new version of netcdf allows onthefly (de)compression of data.
You must use a new version of ncview/ncdump to look at "compressed" data.
Update your path to ncview and ncdump to
/global/apps/netcdf/4.1.1/ncview-2.0b4/bin/ncview
/global/apps/netcdf/4.1.1/bin/ncdump
(or do a module load netcdf)

Small change in NetCDF_ml (ReadField_CDF, larger maxlat for safety).

Bug fix in organic aerosol (VBS) model. Earlier version had too low BSOA yield from terpene oxidation in low-NOx conditions. Increased VBS-yields by a factor 1.5 for TERPPEROXY+HO2 reaction.

   Updated file:

Safer setting of debug_proc, through new subroutine in GridValues
(since best setting needed li0, li1, etc., and this info
only becomes available after Topology called.)

GridValues_ml - debug_proc code moved to separate subroutine

ModelConstants_ml - added DEBUG_GRIDVALUES

Unimod.f90 - call to DefDebugProc added


xxxxxxxx rv3_9_14, Robert 14th Nov 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Updating GenChem.pl to use REAL values for molar weights rather than INTEGER.
         Important for the OA model version.

   ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_SOAageing.reactions
      and
   ZCM_vbs_tests/VBS_partitioning.species
     - Added O_ASOA and O_BSOA species to the VBS-chemistry to keep track of extra oxygen added in
       aging reactions of SOA.

Bug-fixes

  Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml.f90 - small re-arrangement to stop use of
    negative kcloudtop as index  - caught by debug options in Makefile

  BLPhysics_ml.f90
      - added Kdef as required input to JericevicKz and BrostWyngaardKz
        Kz set to Kdef above Hmix
        (should optimise later, as subroutine probably)

   Met_ml
      - pass Kz_m2 (as calculated by Pielke/Blackader) as Kdef, see
        BLPhysics comments
        * Kz previously seems to have become undefined, or strange values




Extensions


  BLPhysics_ml.f90
     VogelezangHoltslag_Hmix added as option
     FluxPROFILE parameter added

  CellMet_ml,    USE_ZREF added - allows reference height to be
     different to lowest z_mid

  Derived_ml - start to simplify outputs, e.g. for HMIX, T2m, etc.
  My_Derived_ml - start to simplify outputs, e.g. for HMIX, T2m, etc.

  DryDep - small debug changes

  GridValues - small debug changes (as some code, and me, is getting
    confused by li0 vs. 1, etc.)

  Landuse_ml
     - added likely_coastal as logical
     - renamed rater_cover to more accurate water_fraction

   LocalVariables_ml - added z_ref as well as z_mid

   Met_ml
      - added "landify" - some in-testing code (commented out)
        may be used in future to ensure that grids with land-cover
        but defined as nwp_sea get their parameters from neighboroughing
        land

   MicroMet_ml
      - added Launiainen1995 possibility  - as default
        (avoids iteration in SubMet)

  ModelConstants_ml -  added USE_ZREF, see CellMet

  SeaSalt_ml - just changed name water_fraction
  Setup_1d_ml - just changed name water_fraction
  SoilWater_ml - just changed name water_fraction

  SubMet_ml - added use of FluxPROFILE == Ln1995 for testing
    (default is still iteration)


  Unimod.f90 - moved call to Topology before MeteoGridRead(cyclicgrid)

T
NetCDF_ml
ModelConstants_ml
Nest_ml
OutputChem_ml
ALL the parameters (variables) are defined (created) in the NetCDF file before the data
is written in the first record.
Because of the way the netcdf is stored, all the data has to be copied each time a new variable is defined,
therefore it is very inefficient to add and write new variables succesively. See
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/Parts-of-a-NetCDF-Classic-File.html#Parts-of-a-NetCDF-Classic-File

This will not improve performance much in yearly runs, but will significantly help short runs: testing, CWF etc.

xxxxxxxx rv3_9_0beta?[not finished yet]  Robert, 11th August 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

NOTE! This version is expected to give slightly changed results compared to
earlier versions (so should be given a new revision number)

ForestFire_ml: Changed the "assumed mass" for particulate OC emissions from wildfires from 0 to 12,
which has a big impact on forest fire OM emissions if the non-C part is modelled!
Important for partitioning OA-models!

Minor bug fix in Biogenics_ml (MW of isoprene changed from 64 to 68)
   -> Will give slightly different isoprene emissions

Updating mk.GenChem with new SOA scheme options (VBS)
   - Added a number of files in ZCM_vbs_tests (VBS_*.reactions and VBS_*.species, used by mk.GenChem to generate the VBS based chemistry schemes)

Many (still preliminary) changes in the VBS versions of My_SOA_ml and My_Derived_ml (in the ZCM_vbs_tests/ directory). Changed names for many of the help species and added possibility to store a number of new fields.

GenChem.pl - now works even without seasalt. Unimod doesn't though :-(

run.pl - ProgDir added for CM_emislist.csv, CM_chempackages.txt

Nest_ml - RCA stuff commented out. Not consistent with CRI

xxxxxxxx rv3_8_7b  Robert, 9th August 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

One major (only influencing VBS-model) and one minor correction/bug fix.

Updating the EMISSPLIT files for OC-emissions in the VBS-scheme.
     Earlier versions had an error in the MASS_ASSUMED.
     Now MASS_ASSUMED = 12 (emissions are assumed given in units of C)

Minor bug fix (should only influence the Log-files)

EmisGet_ml: Earlier version gave erroneous (too large) national total emissions
  in the log files if the same grid point occurs more than once in a given emission file.


xxxxxxxx rv3_8_7   Dave, 9th August 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

FILE CHANGES!!!

   - mk.GenChem and GenChem  do more work :-)
   - No GenIn.reactions or GenIn.species
   - Instead, have sub-sets of these, e.g. EmChem09base, PMmass, ...
   - creates CM_emislist.csv and CM_chempackages.txt to be used
     in run.pl
   - Now, use mk.GenChem to select sub-sets of chemical schemes.
   - run.pl simpler for user because of these changes (no need to set emislist).

FILES REMOVED:
     My_Emis_ml   - not needed now. GenChem figures it out.
     GenIn.species, GenIn.reactions
     ZCM_vbs_tests/GenIn.reactions, GenIn.species  CM_BoundaryConditions.inc
      (the latter should be identical to the EmChem09.)

FILES ADDED:

Other small changes:

 EMIS_NAME becomes EMIS_FILE throughout code. (Easier for GenChem)

 Io_Progs_ml  datewrite formated extended to es11.3. Former 10.3
 merged with negative numbers.

 ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml - some CityZen outputs commented out.

 ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml -  use of NVABSOM. In progress

CityZen updates  (using ZCM_Eucaari_trends and Z_VBS directories)


   Country_ml
    Added countries 170, 171 for extended area

   DustProd_ml
    Moved DEBUG_DUST to ModelConstants_ml
    use CheckStop, not stop (avoids MPI problems)

   ZCM_Eucaari_trends
   ------------------
    Harmonise BICs:
    copied ZCM_EmChem09/SAFE- ... BICs to ZCM_Eucaari_Trends *and* ZCM_vbs_tests

    Changes in GenIn.species:
     Added AER_OM_F as helper species
     removed PM10, PMFINE groups from all SOA species. Only specify
     these groups for AER_OM_F and various EC components.

     Used PMGIANT group for SEASALT_G instead of PMCO - that is for
     the MMD=2.5um particles.

      EMISSPLIT - "_NEW" suffix dropped on emissplit.defaults.ecfi

   ZD_VBS
   -------

   My_Emis_ml added as default for VBS, with ocfi, ecfi. This is a temporary
   measure until GenChem sorts out which emissions are needed.

   My_SOA_ml:  use of AER_OM_F, ECFINE added

   My_Derived_ml: use of AER_OM_F. Commented out some ugN outputs, added
   ug/m3 and some cityzen requests.

   ZD_OZONE
   --------
     hr_out only for O3 as default.

  BICs re-instated for C2H6 and CH3CHO (had ben dropped at some stage), but
  not with much lower CH3CHO than before - 0.3 ppb instead of 2ppb.
  Small effect on concentrations, with only PAN being slightly higher now.

  Another small bug found, we had a reaction [OH] + C2H6  which
  should have been [OH] + C2H6_BIC in old code, now deleted

                     Dave  22nd June 2011 (minor)

Two (small) bugs in the interpolation routines for the Aircraft emissions. (ReadField_CDF in NetCDF_ml)
When the surface pressure of standard atmosphere is smaller than the pressure read from SurfacePressure.nc, the standard surface pressure was modified for all cells in the subdomain, giving a dependence on the number of procs. The differences have only numerical significance.
Also changed the definition of "maxlon" in the routine as, this also could potentially lead to (small) errors.

NB: we still have as default:  USE_AIRCRAFT_EMIS  = .false.


Met_ml -- minor change, > changed to >= for JericevizKz (presumably
   v. little diff, if any.)

Upgrade of the Nest_ml routines.
Can use non-emep netcdf files for BC/IC; flexibilities introduced for nesting:
-vertical coordinates can be hybrid, downwards or upwards, possibly defined in an ad-hoc file (ifs-mozart)
-number of records in each file can be: 1 (RCA), some (mozart), all (emep), variable (transphorm)
-time can be defined with any "days since" date
-time can be defined in a 365days convention, but still use 29th of February (mozart!)
-IC and BC files can be different
-chemical components to be nested can be selected and to some degrees added together
-units can be PPB
-short accepted

The number of opportunities for bugs is huge...

NetCDF_ml: ReadTime more general. Compatible with 365 days calendar

Tove/Dave, 11th May 2011
(Small change for vbs only)

ZCM_vbs_tests/My_Derived  use My_Emis_ml instead of  EmisDef_ml

xxxxxxxx rv3_7_7 Peter,   9th May 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Bug in Nest_ml, when the IC file is different from the BC file (allocated to small ndays_ext).

xxxxxxxx rv3_7_6 Dave,   6th May 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   ***** New emissions setup in GenIn.reactions etc.

   ** My_Emis_ml  is now back, but hopefully easier than before.
   ** CM_Emis.inc removed
   ** CM_EmisSpec.inc created by GenChem
   ** run.pl now uses MonthlyFac.pm25 for unknown emissions labels,
      removing earlier usage of ocfile, ocffl, etc.

   ** Emissions are now at lower heights.


   EmisDef - lower heights for emissions
   EmisGet - deals with new emissions, and checks that we have all
             that are needed (compares emissplit files to CM_EmisSpec list).
   GenChem.pl - changed for new rcemis
   Makefile.SRCS added My_Emis_ml.f90

   ZCM_EmChem09 files adapted for above
   ZCM_vbs_tests files adapted for above for PM25 usage
   ** EMISSPLIT directory added to ZCM_vbs_tests
      (All $Chem should have an EMISSPLIT directory, see below)


  Explanation of main change
  ---------------------------
  In the GenIn.reactions files we now use e.g.:

  rcemis:POC_FFUEL_f =

  then GenChem will make a list of the species which are wanted in
  CM_EmisSpecs.inc, here POC_FFUEL_f.  (the old system needed the name
  of the emission  file, which here was sometimes pm25, sometimes ocfile,
  sometimes ocffl.)

  If the run.pl provides PM25 emissions, the emissplit.defaults.pm25 (which
  should be part of the ZCM_ directory) needs to have POC_FFUEL_f. If
  run.pl provided POC emissions, then emissplit.defaults.ocff would need
  to include the POC_FFUEL_f.

  Thus we let GenChem tell the code which species it needs, and the user
  has to make sure that for that chemistry there are appropriate emissplit
  files.

  EMISSPLIT directories should contain all the emissplit.default etc. files.
  Note that we can have emissplits for many different "grid" files, they do
  not have to be used. Thus, we can have emissplit for "PM25" in the case
  that we run gridPM25, and also an emissplit.defaults.ocfile in case we
  are running with gridOCfine. No need to change GenIn. files or Unimod :-)

Agnes:
Mace Head correction for 2009 is included in GlobalBCs_ml.f90

Robert:
Changed the SOA (VBS) scheme. Now using higher SOA yields from AVOCs and include aging of ASOA, BSOA and POA.
                              Also include dry deposition of gaseous fraction of semi-volatile OOA (ASOA, BSOA and OPOA).

More Bugs fixed:
1. Double declaration of DO_SAHARA in ModelConstants_ml.f90 and GlobalBCs_ml.f90 - Deleted from GlobalBCs.
2. In NetCDF_ml.f90 - correction for number of levels for hourly 3D and columns outputs  [KMAXcdf =min(KMAXcdf ,NLEVELS_HOURLY)]

    ***** MAJOR BUG fixed *******

    - IBC_CO   reset to 125 from 5 ppb. Bug introduced in rv3_7rc6 - do
    not use any of the versions after that, including the open-source!

xxxxxxxx rv3_7_2 Robert 13-15th April xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Very minor update:
Modified the SOA (VBS) code slightly. Replaced the NONVOLOC_GROUP and NONVOLEC_GROUP by NONVOLPCM_GROUP (since these groups are only used for partitioning semivolatile OA between gas and particle phases)

Modified: ZCM_vbs_tests/GenIn.species
          ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml.f90

Updating the SOA (VBS) scheme to include EmChem09 chemistry (earlier versions based on EmChem03)
First test runs: After a bug fix in ZD_VBS/My_Derived_ml.f90 the SOA-code runs. More bugs are still likely. So check results carefully if you run the SOA-model!

Updates should only affect the SOA version of the model.

Modified: ZCM_vbs_tests/GenIn.reactions, GenIn.species, CM_BoundaryConditions.inc
          ZD_VBS/My_Derived_ml.f90, My_SOA_ml.f90

First version of a Nesting with general vertical coordinates. Can use external BIC files such as
MOZART or TRANSPHORM. Needs still some testing and filenames are hardcoded for now.
When new external file are included, more flexibility can be introduced.
Should be backwards compatible. The vertical coordinates are read from the info in the netcdf files,
or an external file in the case they are not found (MOZART).

Modified: Nest_ml, ModelConstants_ml,NetCDF_ml.

Changes to: Country_ml, ModelConstants_ml

MassBudget_ml - printout of fracmass hidden in EXTENDEDMASSBUDGET test,
                 since the calculation is broken somewhere

My_Derived_ml - many outputs removed, including 3d

Formatting in GetEmis_ml, remove Reimer from Solver_ml,

Dave+Peter:
More soil water changes + bug-fix for ws_10m

Landuse_ml - water_cover_set flag added. Needed since water_cover not
     available until nterm > 2

Met_ml .... further manipulation of SoilWater_deep values:

       ! Take a 5x5 average of the land-weighted values for SW. Seems
       !  best not to "believe" NWP models too much for this param, and
       !  the variation in a grid is so big anyway. We aim at the broad
      !  effect. (Alternattve might be to find max values?)

       Also, shallow soil water "switched off" if units /= "m". Seemed
       safest for OpenSource2011

       bug-fix on sw_10m

ModelConstants_ml - smal re-arrangement (alphabetical debugs)

Mosaics_ml  - DEBUG added in "MOS f2D" output

SoilWater_ml, simplified since code now in Met_ml

run.pl  $MetDir added to RunLog outputs. Source of met for 2008 was getting
        confusing!

Alvaro's changes:

Treatment of NetCDF output on FORECAST & SOURCE_RECEPTOR modes:
  - NetCDF files: create only when necesary
  - SOURCE_RECEPTOR mode: no IOU_DAY output
  - FORECAST mode: only IOU_DAY & IOU_HOUR output

run.pl: Small bugx-fix in FORECAST mode

Derived_ml: New public variables iou_min & iou_max contain the min & max
  admisible values for def%iotype to be written out:
  - by defount this correspond to the minval & maxval of f_2d%iotype & f_23%iotype
  - in SOURCE_RECEPTOR mode iou_max=IOU_MON
  - in FORECAST mode iou_min=IOU_DAY

OutputChem_ml: new logical function wanted_iou, to determine if a particular
  def%iotype is to be written out:
  - wanted_iou uses of iou_min & iou_max
  - Output_f2d & Output_f3d use wanted_iou
  - use date2string (TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml) to generate monthly (ASCII) filenames
  - Additional indent & code formatting

Unimod: use wanted_iou to determine if a particular NetCDF file is needed

ERF removed from Functions_ml

Bug corrected 15 March in Met_ml: ws_10 no more high.
INTERIM version. ws_10m seems high

Met_ml.f90: read units and transform deep_soil_water
Met_ml, MetFields_ml, FUTURE_NH3Emis_variation_ml: read wind speed at 10 meters
   into ws_10m removed the parts that defined u10 and v10 separately.

   Added subroutine extendarea to get an array containing neighbours beyond
   MAXLIMAX, MAXLJMAX. Used in SoilWater_ml to average over 3x3 area

Met_ml : dave added temp2 while trying to figure out why sw_10m is so high.
         Should be removed once explanation found!

SeaSalt_ml - modified to use ws_10m, but this ws_10m v. high compared to u_ref
             bug in ws_10m?

SoilWater_ml - now works with IFS and 3x3 average values. The latter needed
            to cope with coastal areas, and adds some robustness (hopefully)

Solver_ml : now switches off Reactions1 if DEBUG_DRYRUN = .true.
            saves some CPU when testing e.g. soil-water or sea-salt
            (sea-salt calcs are in Reactions2)


xxxxxxxx rv3_7rc2  Dave           Mar 13 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Biogenics_ml corrected and cleaned. Notation updated.
  No BVOC_2010 option now - this is the only method. IQ_DMS moved to
  EmisDef_ml, first_dms_read moved to Emissions_ml
  Replaces ExportBIO routine with calls to new printCDF routine

Aqueous_ml - some print-outs moved to DEBUG

Derived_ml - cleanup and DEBUG changes

DryDep_ml  - NO2fac re-instated (for now, until we get a proper soil-NO
              treatment)
             Tidy-up, use of SO2 instead of IXADV_SHL+IADV_SO2 etc.

EmisDef_ml - IQ_DMS added

Emissions_ml - first_dms_read put here

MetFields_ml - small extra tidy-up

ModelConstants_ml - no BVOC_2010 option.

NetCDF_ml  - printCDF added - for "easy" output to cdf in e.g. debugging,
               call printCDF("Example,array,"ugS/m3")

Rurface_ml - small tidy up. Still could do with more (snow)

SeaSalt_ml - changed copyright dates

SetUp_1d_ml - cleaned
Unimod.f90 - BVOC_2010 stuff removed.

run.pl - Inputs.BVOC line removed

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml - DEBUG change

Small bug fixes

run.pl
  - Re-introduced small bug fix from rv3_7beta14, which got lost in rv3_7beta18.
    On SR runs, only AL was reduced.

Output_hourly:
  - Bug fix introduced in rv3_7beta18.
    COLUMNgroup hourly output type was wrongly calculated.
  - Scale factor (f_2d(ispec)%scale) was not used for D2D hourly output type.

Setup_1d_ml:
  - small bug fix regarding rh(k) min & max values, introduced in rv3_7beta24.

Unimod:
  - Fix bug regarding D2D hourly output:
    D2D output fail to find correct index based on f_2d%name.
    The reason is that set_output_defs was called before Init_Derived.
    Therefore, f_2d was not defined when f_2d%name was searched.

Nest_ml & ModelConsants_ml:
  - NEST_MODE introduced in rv3_7beta25 was not being used on Nest_ml.
    Now NEST_MODE is declared as a public parameter in ModelConsants_ml,
    and is used in Nest_ml (ModelConsants_ml, only: ...MODE=>NEST_MODE...).

Nest_ml:
  - type(deriv) components inst, month, year, day where still "in unuse"
    in wrtxn. The lines where commented with !FEB2011 and replaced
    with the corresponding iotype.

Hourly accumulated Dry & Wet depositions available trough D2D hourly output type.
All accumulated D2D variables are now outputted as Hourly accumulated values,
instead of instantaneous values (previous behavior).

ModelConsants_ml:
  - Introduce IOU_HOUR_PREVIOUS=5 (ModelConsants_ml)

Derived_ml:
  - Introduce explicit dependence between LENOUTxD and IOU_*.
    Define LENOUT2D = IOU_HOUR_PREVIOUS and LENOUT3D = IOU_DAY.

Output_hourly:
  - modify D2D hourly output type
    - non accumulated D2D variables (f_2d%avg) are access trough IOU_INST.
      This was the behavior for all D2D variables until version rv3_7_beta21.
    - accumulated variables (.not.f_2d%avg) are now calculated as the
      difference between IOU_YEAR and IOU_HOUR_PREVIOUS.
    - if(hr_out%unit=="")f_2d%unit is used
    - f_2d%scale is always used in conjunction of hr_out%unitconv

My_Outputs_ml:
  - add "sox_wdep" variable to standard hourly output,
    in order to test D2D hourly output type. The max difference between
    WDEP_SOX from fullrun sox_wdep (hourly accumulated variable) and
    is ~1e-4 mgS/m2. This additional variable can be commented on future versions.

Modified handling of start/end dates to allow multi-year runs.
This feature is needed in FORECAST mode, but it is also available for non forecasts.

run.pl:
  - replace $startyear/month/day & $endmonth/day variables for $startdate and $enddate.
    Each $start/$enddate is a string in "YYYY MM DD" format.
    In non FORECAST runs both the YYYY fraction of $startdate and $enddate
    have the same value ($year). In forecast runs $start/$enddate are set
    accordingly to $CWFDATE[1] (forecast start date) and $CWFDATE[2] (end date)
  - remove calc_nterm

Unimod:
  - modify reading of start/endate arrays, so each date is read from a single line.

New module TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml
this new module contains more specific utilities than TimeDate_ml, such as:
   * assign_NTERM:  previously in TimeDate_ml)
   * dayssince1900: previously in NetCDF_ml
   * datefromdayssince1900: previously in NetCDF_ml, Nest_ml & Met_ml

TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml, Makefile.SRCS:
  - new module TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml
  - re-write assign_NTERM, *date/scondssince* procedures
    to take advantage already defined time tools (TimeDate_ml)
    such as tdif_secs. New assign_NTERM code can deal with multi rear runs.
  - nctime2date and date2nctime interfaces take advantage from the
    fact that the current time variable in our netCDF files
    (dayssince1900) is a real variable, while the old one
    (secondssince1970) was an integer variable.
  - date to string conversion function based on string keywords:
    date2string replaces several text keywords by the corresponding
    year, momnt, day, ... for a given date, e.g.
    create a file name from a date2string:
      filename_read_BC=date2string('EMEP_IN_BC_YYYYMMDD.nc',indate)
    time stamp an error message
      call CheckStop( mod((ihh-1)*METSTEP+nhour_first,24), ndate(4),  &
          date2string("NetCDF_ml: wrong meteo hour YYYY-MM-DD hh",ndate))

TimeDate_ml:
  - Add tdif_days & add_days functions
  - move assign_NTERM to TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml (new module)

NetCDF_ml:
  - move dayssince1900 & secondssince1970 to TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml,
    and use general date2nctime interface instead
  - remove datefromdayssince1900, which was unused

Nest_ml & Met_ml:
  - move datefromdayssince1900 & datefromsecondssince1970 to TimeDate_ExtraUtil_ml,
    and use general nctime2idate interface instead

Io_Progs_ml:
  - Include an optional input variable (txt_pattern) into datewrite,
    which indicates if the input text is to be phrased trough str_pattern.
    E.g. the "standard" datewrite call:
      call datewrite("Test", (/ a1, T2, rh /) )
    can be extended into:
      call datewrite("Test YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss",&
                     (/ a1, T2, rh /), txt_pattern=.true.) ! extended call

Unimod, Nest_ml & Met_ml:
  - use date2string for time stamping CWF-dump messages (Unimod),
    obtaining the BC file name on FORECAST mode (Nest_ml) &
    adding date information to error messages.

Other Updates

My_Outputs_ml, Output_hourly:
  - use groups system: chemgroups instead of GROUP_ARRAY & INDEX_XXX_GROUP.

Open Source Clean-ups:

SmallUtils_ml:
  - add optional option 'debug' to find_index & find_indices,
    in order to printout additional debug information.
  - Indent & gFortran-pedantic cleanup.

Main change is usage of iotype in f_2d Deriv arrays. Changes lablled with
FEB2011, pending merge with Alvaro's version and checks for FORECAST mode.

Derived_ml,

   Replaced inst, month, year, day logicals in Derived_ml by integer iotype
   Changes marked with !FEB2011 for now. Will clean up once more changes
   made

My_Derived_ml
    Similar changes, also Mosaic outputs had one extra field for units.
    (now typ_s5i)

Ecosystem_ml - iotype

Mosaics_ml

    Init_MosaicOutputs routine removed. Hardly did anything!
    typ_s5i replaces typ_s4 (am iterating towards full Deriv type!)
    iotype used as input arg to subroutines -set in My_Derived
    find_MosaicLC function added to assign correct LC index,
    acccounting for FULL_GRID=0 (Grid or EU cases)

NetCDF_ml
    iotype usage added
    more error messages in check calls
    commented out def1% inst, month, year, day   - anyway not used

OutputChem_ml
    iotype usage added
    QUERY - need to check usage for FORECAST especially

Unimod.f90
     iotype usage added.

Biogenics_ml, ForestFire_ml, Nest_ml
   commented out def1% inst, month, year, day   - anyway not used

xxxxxxxx rv3_7beta27 Feb 28 2011 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Removed NTERM from run.pl. Instead endday and endmonth are defined and
NTERM is calculated in the model.
Also removed NASS, which was not used anyway.

Note: if enddate is before startdate, 3-hour run is performed.
      if endday is larger than the number of days in the month (for example
        endday=33), it is set as the number of days of the month; this is
        to avoid thinking about leap years etc.
      The new code will not work with old run.pl, since the variables read in have changed.

NB: CWF runs are broken now. run.pl is not yet updated for CWF!

Unimod.f90: call assign_NTERM(NTERM). Better comments when wrong number of PROCS.
TimeDate_ml:defined assign_NTERM(NTERM) and moved startdate,enddate there.
Met_ml: moved startdate,enddate out of this module
ModelConstants_ml and MassBudget_ml: defined EXTENDEDMASSBUDGET to be set
                        as true if all the massbalance output is required

modrun.pl: completely changed and simplified

Clean-up list added to Log.changes - please use!

N2O5_hydrolysis_ml removed - was not being used!

Setup_ml - added max (RH; 1.0e-5) - stops negative RH! (Maybe doesn't
affect results since eg N2O5 usage is only for RH>0.4).

Small tidy-ups:

Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml
ChemFunctions_ml - made VOLFACs public
ModelConstants_ml - added DEBUG_SOLVER, DEBUG_AEROSOL
My_Aerosols_ml
My_Outputs_ml (also added PAN to default SONDE outputs)
Runchem_ml  -  also has some extra debugging code, which I wil remove
               later after implementing N2O5 hydrolysis changes.
Solver_ml   -  also has some extra debugging code, which I wil remove
               later after implementing N2O5 hydrolysis changes.

New (again!) groups system!   Removal of My_WetDep_ml :-)

1. New chemgroups array added in CM_ChemGroups_ml, with pointers to the
   different group arrays, see below.

2. CM_ChemGroups_ml.f90 now kept as separate file, not in CM_ChemSpecs_ml

3. GenChem.pl re-written for the above changes

4. GenChem also makes groups for wet and dry dep automatically, e.g. it
   will figure out WDEP_PM10 or WDEP_DUST  ... the user only has to have
   these properly set in GenIn.species

5. My_WetDep_ml merged with Aqueous_ml - > Aqueous_n_WetDep_ml. All chemistry
   dependencies are now through the imported CM_WetDep.inc file.


These changes also make "older" code like ZCM_Eucaari_Trends, or newer
code like CRI_v2_R5, work again since we have avoided the need for
hard-coded groups.

More on the new group system:

from before we had something like:
 integer, public, target, save, dimension(2) :: &
             NOX_GROUP     = (/ NO,NO2 /)

and which could be accessed by searching for "NOX_GROUP" in the (messy!) GROUP_ARRAY, as something like:
, gtype( "NOX", 2, (/ NO,NO2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 /) ) &

Now we use an array chemgroups which uses pointers. For example, "NOX" in
chemgroups is specified with:

 p => NOX_GROUP
 chemgroups(8) = typ_sp("NOX", p )

Search for NOx and you get the full array of NOX_GROUP.

Much easier!

So far I have only implemented this for wet deposition, so look there for examples.


Other changes:

Derived_ml
   clean-out of old and unneeded code - e.g. old GROUP stuff

My_Outputs_ml:
  Set FORECAST default output in an IF, instead of commented code.
  Full model domain is to be outputed for 10 pre-defined variables.

Output_hourly:
  group COLUMN calculations

My_Outputs_ml, Output_hourly:
  - use INDEX_*_GROUP (from ChemGroups_ml) for identification of groups
  - Partial/Full COLUMN/COLUMgroup calculations:
    hr_out%nk indecate the number of levels in the column,
      1<%nk<KMAX_MID  ==>  Partial column: %nk lowermost levels
         oterwise     ==>  Full column: all model levels
  - cleanup: gFortran pedantic; removal of old comments & old commented code

My_Outputs_ml, Sites_ml:

Major re-write of AOT, POD, VEGO3_OUTPUTS and associated simplification
of Derived system

 *** needs new input files for DO3SE  *********

 - AOTnPOD_ml - replaces AOTx_ml.
   This module now collects together much of the code for
   processing AOTs and fluxes (PODs). Includes O3cl type which
   defines allowed outputs. e.g.

    VEGO3_DEFS    =  (/ &
   O3cl( "POD1_IAM_DF   ",   "POD", 1.0,  "- ", "IAM_DF",F,0,999 ), &
   O3cl( "POD0_IAM_DF   ",   "POD", 0.0,  "- ", "IAM_DF",F,0,999 ), &
   O3cl( "MMAOT40_TC    ","AOT", 40.0, "MM", "TC    ",F,0,999 ), &

 so that My_Derived  just needs to give the names wanted, e.g. POD1_IAM_DF

   Accumulation period for calculation defined in this array, so
   older (and inflexible!) WheatGrowingSeason removed.

 -  My_Derived_ml - see new O3cl types

 -  DO3SE_ml changed, also with extra input param: VPDcrit

  associated changes in

   Derived_ml  (Threshold removed from Deriv type, SOMO changed, ..)
                accumlate_2dyear removed

   Ecosystems_ml
   Makefile.SRCS - AOTnPOD_ml replaces AOTx_ml
   ModelConstants_ml  - removed need for STO_FLUXES
   MosaicOutputs

   StoFLux_ml
      - use of VPDcrit

 - Unimod - more timing calls added

Some gfortran pedantic cleanups in

    DryDep_ml
    LandDefs_ml
    Landuse_ml
    SoilWater_ml - Alvaro's change

Retabished the original way of making the last met record in run.pl (see rv3_7beta15)
and instead changed Met_ml:
When the first record when starting a new year is not found, use the same value
for metdata as in 31 December (21:00 values instead of 00:00 next day).

Changed also calc_nterm in run.pl, to take into account the first day (dd1).

Clean-up code changes, single-year run.pl,  and 1 bug fix.....

 *** Bug-fix ***  in Volcanoes_ml - coordinates were wrong for
        EMEP/EECCA cases
        Also, DEBUG_VOLC moved to ModelConstants_ml

 *** code cleaned/removed ***

  1)  My_Derived_ml, Derived_ml  - simpler outputs :-)

      Now use the one array SURF_CONCS to specify outputs, with
      desired unit. Replaces SURF_UG_S, SURF_UG_N, SURF_UG_C,
      SURF_UG and SURF_PPB. Now say e.g.:

     type(typ_ss), public, parameter, dimension(26) :: &
           SURF_CONC = (/ typ_ss("SO2", "ugS"),&
                          typ_ss("SO4", "ugS"),&
                          typ_ss("NO", "ugN"),&
                          typ_ss("O3", "ppb"),&
           .....

     Associated changes in:
      OwnDerivedTypes_ml ... added typ_ss for pair of text strings


  2)  My_DryDep_ml - deleted :-)

      Not needed now since CM_DryDep.ninc has all the important information -
      now this is imported to DryDep

      Associated changes in:

       DryDep_ml
       MassBudget_ml
       ModelConstants_ml  - now has USE_STO_FLUXES
       Sto_Fluxes_ml

Small changes concerning FORECAST & FORECAST-SR modes

run.pl: - Naming for Nest-IC/re-start (dump) files under FORECAST-SR mode
        - Small bug fixes on the Perl code for SR mode

Nest_ml: Bug fix on FORECAST mode. The Nest-BC (IFS-Mozart) files where not found/read.
  The BC variables were searched on the Nest-BC files
  before the filenames where set to the corresponding date.
  Therefore, the Nest-BC file and all of its variables where considered missing.

Makefile_titan: homogenize with Makefile_stallo
  - MPI: use openmpi library as in stallo.
    This replaces the scampi library, which will be discontinued in June 2011.
  - IFORT: use same options than Makefile_stallo.
    Because of the -shared-intel option it is of VITAL IMPORTANCE to have
    the same modules available for compilation and run.
    In titan this is done by the following command line:
      module load intel/11.1u8 openmpi/1.4.3.intel

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_7beta13  Peter        Dec 21 2010 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


the -recursive option seems to be useful for the compiler. If omitted it may give this
kind of error messsages for large grids:

Generate 3D precipitation if it is missing. Use 2D precipitations and 3D cloudwater.
If Cloudwater is missing use relative humidity (derived from specific humidity) instead.
Units are assumed as in EECCA/metdata_EC, i.e. m/s for surface precipitation and kg/kg for cloudwater

ToDo: consider replacing lwc (computed from cc3d) with cw (read from metdata)

(removed -recursive from Makefile: it is no more required)

Fixed run.pl
    Dust switched off for "EMEP" grid since we don't have the data file
    yet. (Solution will be to netcdf the files, not to have one in each
    LOCAL_DATA dir.)

Added pm25 and pmco files to ZCM_EmChem09/EMISSPLIT

(Not updated in Eucaari directory yet. Need to decide how much detail
with which to split pm25.)

More use of PrintLog in Unimod.f90 - to record which switches were used in RunLog.

Dust changes

   - USE_DUST and DO_SAHARA put in ModelConstants_ml (where
    similar switches are kept). Makes it easier to switch off for EMEP domain.

   RunChem_ml and Dust_ml only if USE_DUST

   ZD_OZONE/MyAerosols - DUST logical replaced by USE_DUST from ModelConstants

New group system started --- not finished!

  Changes to handle groups better, and get rid of hard-coding in Derived_ml
  (The rv3_7eucaari version would not compile with EmChem09 chemistry.)

GenChem.pl now produces extra group info in CM_ChemSpecs_ml, with
   a new type gtype, e.g.

    type(gtype), public, parameter, dimension(18) :: &
       GROUP_ARRAY = (/ &
 gtype( "SOX", 2, (/ SO2,SO4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 /) ) &
  ......

My_Derived_ml:   now has SURF_UG_GROUP = (/ "SIA", "PM25",  ....

   - works the same way as for SURF_UG = (/ "SO2", .....

   - BUT - I haven't had time to make SURF_UG_N_GROUP, SURF_PPB_GROUP etc.
     [Note: Should redesign again with units specified with name,
       eg SURF_GROUP = (/ pair( "SIA", "ugm3"), pair("OXN", "ugNm3"), &
                          pair("NOX", "ppb") /) or similar....    ]

   - outouts called SURFGRP_UGM3_SOX etc.... [Note: Will rename to just SURF_
     once the older SURF stuff is erased for groups.

   - D2_PM removed. Functionality in above or elsewhere

   Thus the former SOX_GROUP is not needed, but just the character array "SOX".
   This avoids compilation problems where groups do note exist (eg "BSOA")
   and allows looping.


Derived_ml

   - all groups that are defined in SURF_UG_GROUP now removed from
   Derived_ml. Instead we use AddNewDeriv for SURF_UG_GROUP similar
   to for SURF_UG. Gets rid of lots of lines (currently commented
   out with !GRPD

   - flex_uggroup_calc routine removed. All can be done with the original uggroup_calc

Also
   Dust_ml : MasterProc used to limit outputs (should use in
    preference to me == 0 anyway.)

   NetCDF_ml - bug fix on ReadField_CDF:
        if(imax==1)imax=dims(1)!covered entire circle


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_7eucaari xxxxx Many authors !! 21 Nov 2010 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   *New directory*

    ZCM_Eucaari_Trends - use instead of EmChem09 for EUCAARI work.

    Has VBS SOA chemistry from Robert.  Note that instead of EC_f_new we
    now have EC_f_FFUEL_new, EC_f_WOOD_new, etc. Not perfect (as we don't
    have wood emissions) but it limits the number of SOA schemes used.

    Has changed  GenIn.species for SOA (DryDep fom Robert has gas-phase dep
    of SOA)

    Contains EMISSPLIT -  split files


  Other:

  Advection_ml - added min(ps3d) safety checks

  Biogenic_ml - * fixed bug * for terpene emissions. Added EmisNat for BIO_TERP
    - reset to 2003-style emissions to keep consistent with Robert's SOA
      clearer coding of differences I hope

  Derived_ml - Idirect, Idiffuse, T2m and *lots* of 3D options added
  My_Derived_ml - Idirect, Idiffuse, T2m options added
                - outputs reduced for EUCAARI runs. (still v. many)

  run.pl - various EUCAARI options.

  ModelConstants_ml - added HIRHAM and DRYRUN flag
                    - switched on deep soil water :-)

    Then the volcanoes from gridSOX and Vocanos.dat are not used!

    NB: femis.dat reductions will not work anymore on country=28 (volcanoes)

    The conversion to grid coordinates should be automatic.

Biogenics_ml:

Switch on BVOC_2010 methods, uses file EMEP_Euro
Add terpene emissions (only BVOC_2010 so far, older 2003 stuff not updated)

ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.species: added for testing  rcbio(BIO_TERP,k)   = APINENE ;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_7beta5 Robert/Dave  Oct 28th xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ModelConstants_ml - Minor update, now use TXTLEN_NAME to set length of some strings that used to be hard coded as 12 characters (now TXTLEN_NAME is set to 20 to allow for slightly longer chemical species names) TXTLEN_NAME is used in My_Outputs_ml, EmisGet_ml and MassBudget_ml

Also updated/revised the SOA scheme to a simpler version treating all primary OA from fossil fuel as nonvolatile (not yet decided if this is the "best" default SOA scheme)

Add PPM25_FIRE, + CO_FIRE to GenIn.species

run.pl - switched to "JAN" directory for emissplit - as this has the fire components

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_7beta4 Dave  Oct 26th xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Aero_Vds_ml - small increase in rates (0.006 -> 0.008)

DryDep_ml -  removed special treatment of NO2, and added higher deposition rates
for nitrate-like particles

GenChem.pl - now outputs RO2POOL line in CM_Reactions1.inc if needed

mk.GenChem - copies SAFE.CM_BoundaryConditions_ml.f90 to CM_BoundaryConditions_ml.f90

(make sit easier to do rm CM_* in ZCM_EmChem09)

Solver_ml - now uses RO2_GROUP

Wesely_ml - added PMfS, PMfS distinction and AERO_SIZE

ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.species - use PMfS or PMfN for sulphur-like (non-dissociating
) or nitrate-like (dissoctating) particles


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_7beta3 Dave  Oct 21st xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Small changes:

  Derived_ml   POD, AOT added in case statement

run.pl:   dd1 introduced.... start day

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_7beta1 Dave  Sep 30th xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Quite large changes - mainly to simplify and clean up, partly in preparation
for new BVOC + soil water systems. The switch to "beta" is to emphasise that
now we are working towards the rv3_7 public domain release. Clean ups and
simplification are encouraged ;-)

Two new modules:

    DerivedFields_ml - stores f_2d, d_2d here (avoided circularity problems)
    MosaicsOutputs_ml

      Much moved to MosaicOutputs_ml
      Much removed and replaced by use of Grid% Sub(iL)%
      (ie much cleaner I hope!)

Changes in AOT, Fst calculations.

AOTx_ml  - simpler because of new o3cl types

Biogenics_ml - much changed. A work in progress

CellMet_ml -  small additions

DerivedFields_ml added - stores f_2d, d_2d here (avoided circularity problems)

Derived_ml - changes mainly due to DerivedFields_ml

DryDep_ml  - ** bug fix ** on cano3

DO3SE_ml   - mainly changed lu to iLC. Will try to keep same index throughout
             Unimod.

Io_Progs_ml : added datewrite - simplifies printout of current_date plus
              other data.

ModelConstants_ml - several new DEBUGs

MosaicOutputs_ml - moved loads of code from My_DryDep and DryDep_ml here
                   Still too messy, but most in one place at least.

   DryDep_ml     - much shorter because of above
   My_DryDep_ml  - *very* much shorter because of above. Almost nothing left :-)
   My_Derived_ml - *very* much shorter because of above.

OwnDataTypes : type o3cl added t cope with AOTX, PODY

PhyChe: extra debug coding - added subroutine debug_concs to save some lines

Setup_1d_ml: some  changes because of Bioegenic work. A work in progress

StoFlux_ml :  cleanup

SR on FORECAST mode: script changes & bug fix

run.pl:
  * SR on FORECAST mode: allow SR & CWF options to coexist.
    Modify EMEP::Sr::getScenario to create CWF-SR scenarios.
    Use different dump files for different SR ensemble members.
  * One country per Job task: If multiple tasks are submitted (e.g. #PBS -t 1-56),
    use $ENV{'PBS_ARRAYID'} to select one element of @countries.
    This removes the need for multiple scripts for parallel partial-SR runs,
    as each country is handled by a single task and each task dealt
    independently by the pbs-job-loader.
  * MOZART-IFS BC in forecast mode: Use previous day BC if the file is not
    not yet available for the base-date.
  * Formatting/indentation.

Sites_ml: Fix SOURCE_RECEPTOR bug.
  Crash only on SR runs with message "SITES D2D NOT FOUND HMIX".
  This was because, on SR runs, D2_EXTRA is not added to wanted_deriv2d
  by Init_My_Deriv (My_Derived_ml). Therefore "HMIX" is not wanted,
  but is still required by SITE_XTRA_CODE (My_Outputs_ml).
  The impasse was solved by processing SITE_XTRA/SITE_XTRA_CODE only
  if(.not.SOURCE_RECEPTOR).

PhyChem_ml: No hourly, site & sonde outputs for SR runs.
  Though it says in the code that hourly and daily are not written out
  in the SR case, hourly output was still produced.
  Now hourly will be produced for FORECAST-SR runs.
  Hindcast SR runs will not produce hourly output.
  Site & sonde outputs will not be produced for SR runs

My_Derived_ml: Controlling the output variables.
  Not writing out the emissions, deposition velocities,
  resistances for different landuses and 3D variables.

SoilWater_ml, Nest_ml: gFortran pedantic fix for logical statements

NetCDF_ml: comments put in beginning of interpolation routines  ReadField_CDF and Read_Inter_CDF

Dave:
GenChem.pl - length of species%name extended from 12 to 22

DryDep_ml, Landuse_ml: LU_cdf variable removed - not used

DryDep_ml, StoFLux_ml:  debug statements re-formatted to fit < 78 chars per line.

More  GenChem and SOA-related changes

GenChem.pl  --- now used to set NEMIS_FILES and EMIS_FILES. Add wanted
emission file as prefix to rcemis, e.g.:

    nox:rcemis(NO,k)                           = NO    ;
    nox:rcemis(NO2,k)                          = NO2    ;
    sox:rcemis(SO2,k)                          = SO2    ;
    sox:rcemis(SO4,k)                          = SO4    ;
    co:rcemis(CO,k)                           = CO    ;
    voc:rcemis(C2H6,k)                         = C2H6    ;
    voc:rcemis(NC4H10,k)                       = NC4H10    ;

With modified:
   ZD_xx/GenIn.reactions
   (also cleaned up - commented-out dry dep lines removed)


NOTE: these prefixes are only used for the standard gridded emissions files
 - the ones that were in EMIS_FILES. We also have rcbio and possibly rcnh3
for isoprene, terpene, etc.

SOA_ml removed!!
 REplaced by ZD_OZONE/My_SOA_ml  or ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml

ZD_VBS added

ZD_VBS/My_SOA_ml - now uses PCM_GROUP, PCM_HELP_GROUP from GenIn.species

ZCM_vbs_tests added - just for testing by Robert/Dave.

My_Aerosols_ml : ORGANIC_AEROSOLS flag removed. Moved to My_SOA_ml

EmisDef - now uses CM_Emis.inc  -- hence is chemistry independent :-)

Use modified rcbio:
  Runchem_ml - uses modified rcbio
  Setup_1d_ml - uses modified rcbio
  Setup_1dfields_ - stores modified rcbio
  Solver_ml


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_21 Dave/Robert   Aug 20 2010 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

More SOA consistency and modified soilwater handling when USE_SOILWATER
set true --- this *will* change results! Lower DryDep when soil
is dry -> more O3, etc. in Southern Europe


Aqueous_ml - modified for consistency with SOA module - uses
      Fpart for semivolatile species. Small changes in notation
      also

CellMet_ml - added fSW, Grid%fSW

Derived_ml - used BVOC array t set NatEmis Derived, instead of hard-coded C5H10.
             changed old write_debug to write_debugadv
            added simpler write_debug for other components than adv

DO3SE_ml - uses new fSW instead of older DO3SE method.
           Added debug_flag to g_stomatal + f_SW in DEBUG outputs

DryDep_ml  - modified for consistency with SOA module - uses Fpart for semivolatile species.
      Added fSW to prepare for soil-water changes.
      Small changes in notation also.

GenChem.pl - modified for SOA treatment. Use typ=2 in GenIn.species
  and add SOA, ASOA etc. in groups to get e.g. SOA_GROUP in CM_ChemSpecs_ml.
  Uses FIRST_SEMIVOL instead of FIRST_SOA, same for LAST

  Note that the DeltaH and Cstar info is now part of chemicals%

LocalVariables_ml - added fSW

mk.GenChem - removed CM_SOA_ml

ModelConstants_ml: Added USE_SOILWATER

Rsurface_ml - more debug options

run.pl - sets USER from $ENV{"USER"} - easier and safer!

Sites_ml - improved debug options

SOA_ml - uses FIRST_SEMIVOL instead of FIRST_SOA, same for LAST

SoilWater_ml - start of "real" soil-water handling, generating fSW
    from SoilWater_deep. Not used yet.
     (HIRLAM-tested only)

StoFlux.f90 - bug fix on evapotranspiration calculation - avoid div  by zero

ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.species - some fake species added to test SOA+GenChem.
   Commented out for now, just uncomment to try.

MOZART-IFS BC in forecast mode: Use top boundary from BC file.

Nest_ml:
  * Use top boundary from BC file.
    The new logical parameter TOP_BC controles this feature.
    Top boundary is read into new variable xn_adv_bndt.
  * Bug fix. Lateral BC were wrongly set to zero.
    Subroutine read_newdata_LATERAL read boundary values into local variables,
    instead of global ones of the same name (xn_adv_bnd{w,e,s,n}).
  * Bug fix. The assignment itime=Next/itime=Next_BC after the time finding
    loop on reset_3D/read_newdata_LATERAL) causes that the wrong record to be read
    when the "right date-time" is not found.
    When there is no "right date-time" on the IC/BC file the index 'n'
    is outside of the valid range for records, and therefore the program crashes
    when trying to read beyond the last record.
  * Boundary variables (xn_adv_bnd{w,e,s,n,t}) are only allocated on the processors
    that will use them
  * New interer variables iw, ie, js, jn & kt contain the indexes corresponding
    to the west, east, south north and top boundaries.
  * Clean up & indentation.

ModelConstants_ml:
  * Correct string lenght for DomainName="EMEPCWF-0.25degEurope"
  * Clean up & indentation.

Bug-fixes again .... old ones (rv3_5_15!) which somehow got lost

Derived_ml:

   BUG fix: somo_calc. SOMO35 was calculated incorrectly (somo_calc used index, wereas
   XYCL should be used, to get the 35.). Added debug_flag to somo_calc also.
   debug flags added to somo_calc

AOTx_ml: BUG_fix: scaling with dt_advec/3600 removed. dt-scale does this.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_18   Dave  16th Aug 2010

Bug-fixes! WDEP and DDEP of groups didn't include all species.
(bug started from rv3_5_27 probably)

Aqueous_ml - added debug_flag to WetDeposition call

Derived_ml - IsSurf replaced by ik==0

GenChem.pl -  bug fixed. Hadn't spotetd that aNH4 was same as ANH4 for wdep groups - now
     now uses sub spec_equal

ModelConstants_ml
   - added DEBUG_WETDEP, DEBUG_MY_WETDEP

ZCM_EmChem09/GenIn.reactions - added rcnh3 in GenIn.reactions, used for Haldis's
     system (was in CM_Reactions2.inc. Remember - stuff in CM_ is generated by
     mk.GenChem, so new equations should be written in GenIn.reactions, not
     CM files.)

ZD_OZONE/My_WetDep_ml - added debug_flag

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_16      Alvaro  16th Aug 2010

Use MOZART-IFS BC in forecast mode

Derived_ml.f90 - bug-fix on uggroup outputs

  * Additonally, some do-->forall replaces and gfortran-pedantic fixes

ModelConstants_ml:
  * Add DEBUG_NEST_ICBC parameter

run.pl:
  * Additional code for handeling forecast BC files from MOZART-IFS

Some changes to make the model portable to different machine/compilers
(and some cleaning)

Advection_ml:
Some simplifications to test for allowed dt_advec.
Cleaning/commenting of convection_pstar

Met_ml:
"readneighbors" is made MPI_safe (could hang for very large grids).

NetCDF_ml:
recursive ReadField_CDF (so we don't need to use compiler options)

Derived_ml:
splitted "if(present(iIs3D).and.Is3D)", as xlf (IBM/njord) seems to
test Is3D before looking if it is present

Unimod.f90:
Moved call parinit upward, because parinit defines MaterProc, which was used before it was set.



xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_14      Dave   9th Aug 2010

Derived_ml: XYCL renamed to Threshold :-)
            EVAP, SoilWater, PREC_WDEP outputs added as Derived

and a pain!

StoFlux_ml: Evapotranspiration added  (1st attempt, should be optimised)

My_Derived_ml: outputs for POD for ex-post analysis, + EVAP, SoilWater

               Code for "NOX" commented out. Have both NO and NO2 as
               outputs anyway, and should treat NOX as just another
               group.

My_Outputs_ml: ITE_XTRA_INDEX, SONDE_XTRA_INDEX commented out

run.pl: pre-defined  benchmark datasets

The benchmark sets indicate the grid, time period (full year)
and emissions to use.
There are, so far, two benchmark sets (my %BENCHMARK):
  %BENCHMARK = (grid=>"EMEP" , year=>2005,
                emis=>"Modrun07/OpenSourceEmis"     );
  %BENCHMARK = (grid=>"EECCA", year=>2007,
                emis=>"Modrun09/2009-Trend2007-CEIP");

There are two additional keys to fine tune the benchmark behaviour:
  $BENCHMARK{'debug'}   = 0;  # chech if all debug flags are .false.
  $BENCHMARK{'archive'} = 0;  # save summary info in $DataDir

if $BENCHMARK{'archive'}, summary info is copied to:
  $DataDir/Benchmark/$GRID.$year/BM_$testv-$Chem.$USER

You can find such info for rv3_6_10-EmChem09 (run in titan)
for both EMEP.2005 and EECCA.2007 benchmarks in:

Updates relted to the forecast mode

Unimod & PhyChem_ml:
  Bug fix in forecast mode. The hourly output for the "zero hour" was wrong.

ModelConstants_ml:
  Add GEMS 0.25 extended (Eyjafjallaj\"okull) and MACC 0.20 domain definitions.

Derived_ml:
  Allow daily output for SOURCE_RECEPTOR calculations in FORECAST mode

Nest_ml:
  only 1 FORECAST_NDUMP (re-start file) by default

Advection_ml:
  advection timestep (dt_advec) set assign_dtadvec according to grid resolution
  also in FORECAST mode. Before it was set to 10 min, independently of the
  grid resolution. Now it is set as for non FORECAST runs.
  GEMS025 domain 0.25 deg resol --> GRIDWIDTH_M~=27.8 km --> dt_advec=20 min
  MACC02  domain 0.20 deg resol --> GRIDWIDTH_M~=22.2 km --> dt_advec=20 min

Output_hourly:
 -Only postive hr_out%max values will be check for excedance.
 -New hourly output types (hr_out%type)
    BCVugXX     ug/m3, ugC/m3, ugS/m3, ugN/m3 at model mid-levels
    ADVugXXg    GROUP output in ug/m3 at the surface
    BCVugXXg    GROUP output in ug/m3 at model mid-levels
    PMwater     PM water content (PM_water) at model mid-levels
    COLUMN      Column output in ug/m3, ugC/m3, ugS/m3, ugN/m3 or molec/cm2

My_Outputs_ml:
 -Add standard forecast houtly output hr_out (commented).
 -Define to_ug_S and to_ug_N as arrays, matching to_ug_ADV definition
  for ug output ("ADVugXX" hourly output type).
  Add to_ug_C, to_molec_cm3 and to_molec_cm2 conversions.

My_Outputs_ml, Output_hourly & NetCDF_ml: selected model levels on hourly output
 -New parameters SELECT_LEVELS_HOURLY (logical) and
  LEVELS_HOURLY (array of level indexes) indicate if and which levels
  to output (My_Outputs_ml).
 -Modify hourly_out (Output_hourly), Init_new_netCDF and CreatenetCDFfile (NetCDF_ml)
  to allow feature. CreatenetCDFfile has a new optional parameter 'KLEVcdf'
  to hold levels to be outputed.
 -Backwards comptability provided by SELECT_LEVELS_HOURLY=.false. (default).

NH3variables_ml.f90: gFortran compliance...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_10    Dave,       3rd Aug    2010

FOREST_FIRES reset to false in EmisDef. Robert has noticed that
   results depend on processor number, so there must be a bug.

NH3EMIS_VAR test added before linking NH3 sector data in run.pl

NB - there is no read permission on Haldis's sector NH3 file, so
the code won't  run with NH3EMIS_VAR anyway. Will fix once
Haldis returns.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_9     Haldis,    22st July   2010

New temporal ammonia emissions, only for a restricted area.
Default is set as the old ammonia emission,
new temporalemissions can be choosen by setting NH3EMIS_VAR=true in EmisDef
and in run.pl
This method requires 10m wind from meteorology, this exist in meteofields for
2006 and 2008

New modules:
NH3Emis_variation_ml.f90:
                sets up scaled emissionfactors, so they are never higher
                than 1. Uses then the potential emission factor from
                Tmp_ml.f90

Tmp_Met_ml.f90 (contains temporary reading of meteorology and reading of
                emissions):
                -sets up the potential emission factor in each grid at each
                 timestep
                -calculates the time for maximums in the gauss functions
                -reads the NH3 emissions, and make them equal to the reported
                 emissions (from EmisDef_ml and EmisGet_ml), scale them to 50km
                 grid and surface fluxes instead of tonn pr year
                -reads in T2m and 10m winds from meteofiles
NH3variables_ml.f90 (contains variables used in Tmp_Met and NH3Emis_variation)

Advection_ml: Bug in rv3_6_2 correction:should not multiply bi ps-PT too!

NetCDF_ml - deallocate added for Nvalues, small debug change

NetCDF_ml: added "recursive" for ReadField_CDF routine

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_4     Dave,    9th June   2010

Advection_ml returned to former, otherwise normal runs give NaN
   I have added the new suggestion as a commented ourt block though
   awaiting attention from Peter
   see "QUERY" bit.

NetCDF_ml modified

   known_projection added as optional. Allows user to
   specify e.g. MEGAN data as "lon lat", without need
   to modify original MEGAN files.

   Lots of debug statements added! Will reduce later

   FillValues treatment extended+safer  (hope Peter agrees!)

Interpolation_ml - more

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_3     Dave,    9th June   2010

CM_WetDep.inc added to ZCM_EmChem09.  Note that in principal
this isn't needed. One gets these files by typing mk.GenChem.
Will clean up this behaviour one day, and just keep
GenIn files rather than the CM_ outputs.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_2     Peter,   8th June   2010

Advection_ml: divide xn_advec by max(1,ps3d) instead of ps3d also if no convection is used.
This will put a very small value for the concentrations, instead of NaN, in the case where
wind fields are very divergent.
(Joffen reported that the advection gave NaN on north pole)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6_1     Dave,   4th June   2010

New Module: InterpolationRoutines_ml

 - created as merge of bilinear code from Functions_ml and Peter's
  grid2grid_coeff. Small caller routine Nearest4 added, as well as
  test-code which can be uncommented for stand-alone testing.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_6        XXXXXXXXX TO BE BACK_ADDED XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

REPORT 1/2010 version will be added as a branch. Note that rv3_6 was
really based upon rv3_5_25, so things got a bit confused here. Still,
no worries ;-)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_27    Dave,  28th May   2010

GenChem.pl changes:   GenIn.species is now a comma-separated file which
  can be edited in gnumeric, and contains details of the dry and wet dep,
  also other params such as extinction coefficient and VBS details.

ZCM_EmChem09:
    GenIn_species.csv created as above
    GenIn.Reactions - deposition stuff removed

Derived_ml     - extended for more groups (tNO3, OXN...)

GlobalBCs_ml   - test about ZD_OZONE removed

ModelConsants_ml - model changed to EMEP-MSC-W instead of ZD_OZONE

ChemSpecs_bgn_ml, Chem_ml: Content of ChemSpecs_bgn_ml moved into Chem_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_26    Dave,  26th May   2010

More GenChem enabled, with use of "groups" to avoid hard-coded indices:

GenChem.pl and mk.GenChem  now in Unimod directory. Edit the ZCM_xxx/GenIn files
to change reactions, depositions, etc.

mk.GenChem - runs GenChem.pl and copies CM to current directory.

GenChem.pl

   1) Dep changes:
   GenChem now produces CM_WetDep_ml

   Define which species are deposited in GenIn.reactions, e.g.

     DRY_NO2    -           NO2      =    ;
     DRY_SO2    WET_SO2     SO2      =    ;
     DRY_FIN    WET_SO4     SO4      =    ;
     DRY_FIN    WET_PMf     aNH4     =    ;
     DRY_FIN    WET_PMf     pNO3_f   =    ;

  The idea is that we have some "CALC" compounds defined in My_WetDep_ml,
  My_DryDep_ml, and can give the deposition rates of the species in terms
  of these. Thus, we can use the WET_PMf rate for any fine particle,
  we just need to define it once.

  Aqueous_ml - rewritten to use the new CM_WetDep_ml approach.

  DryDep_ml - rewritten to use the slightly renamed CM_DetDep_ml indices

   2) Groups
   Groups are defined in GenIn.species, e.g.

     SO4   1  SO4        -  8.5  0  0      PM25,SIA,SOX,AOD  !

   - adds SO4 to PM25_GROUP, SIA_GROUP, SOX_GROUP, AOD_GROUP
    These groups can then be used in the rest of the code, so that
    now we can get things like PM25 as the sum of all species in
    PM25_GROUP; Avoids lots of lijnes with IXADV_PPM25, IXADV_SO4 ..
    etc.

   - the 8.5 0 0 are for AOD and VBS calculations. Will refine one day,
     but these numbers are now added as species(..)%extC, %Cstar, %DeltaH
     in CM_ChemSpecs_ml

  Derived_ml changed with such group calculations. See pmgroup_calc
  routine.

  Also:

    spotted outputs of PM in ppb, which has to be wrong. PM c an only have
    mass output since we don't know the mol. wt.

    Affects Derived_ml (3d outputs) and Sites_ml

Name changes (provisional)

  aNO3 -> pNO3_f
  pNO3 -> pNO3_c
  SSFi -> SeaSalt_f
  SSCO -> SeaSalt_c

In Ammonium_ml,

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_25    Peter  28th April 2010

New version of ReadField_CDF. Simpler and more robust (when FL are below surface).


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_24    Peter  27th April 2010

In order to be able to read the aircraft emissions given in flight levels, the
ReadField_CDF routine has been adapted for this very specific task.
It must use monthly surface pressure average. This is given in a separate file,
which is produce from IFS 0.2 degrees 2008.
The Makefile must be adapted for recursive calls.
Gives slightly different results, since topography is taken into account now

Files modified:
NetCDF_ml.f90, Emissions_ml.f90, run.pl, Makefile, Makefile_stallo, Functions_ml.f90,ModelConstants_ml
(put NPROCX=4, since there are only advantges running on stallo with 8 compred to 6 CPU)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_23    Peter, Dave  23rd April 2010

ReadField_CDF:
Can read latlon fields with undefined values. Define UnDef to give value put into
 the gridcells which are not defined.

PhysicalConstants_ml: earthradius


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_22    Dave,  22nd April 2010

DryDep, My_DryDep, My_Derived

Bug-fix needed when reducing number of Derived outputs:

  Hard-coded numbers (1..3) in Mosaic_Met for RTH replaved by MMC_RH
  MMC_USTAR etc.  Prevents assignment when variables now asked for in My_Derived

Also number of default outputs reduced. Will continue this process further
one day. Use of d_2d and EXTRA_SITES in My_Outputs also very crude - should
really be improved,... one day.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_21    Peter, Alvaro,   21st April 2010

Two bugs found by Alvaro (CWF):
Nest_ml: istart,jstart,iend,jend, was wrongly defined in mode 11,12 or forecast

NetCDF_ml:"if((abs(rdays-rdays_time(1))>0.00001))"
replaced "<" with ">". Used when outputting 3D on a limited number of levels.

Cleaned the  ReadField_CDF routine

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_18    Dave,   14th April 2010

run.pl

    -- modified to do some checks which will avoid the previously
    unhelpful crash of the code with missing rough.dat error. This
    was 99% of the time casued by $GRID being set to one domain in
    run.pl, but the ModelConstants_ml had an other domain.

    We now check the x-dimension of ModelConstants, and in  run.pl:

 die "Domain mis-match Model: $XDIM Grid $GRID" if (
    ( $GRID eq "EMEP" && $XDIM != 170 ) or
    ( $GRID eq "EECCA" && $XDIM != 132 ) or
    ( $GRID eq "GLOBAL" && $XDIM != 360 ) );

In addition, run.pl now compares the CM_ChemSpec file in your
Unimod directory with that in ZCM_$Chem. This might help if we have an EmChem09RF
version for example. The $Chem variable is added to runlabel2 and so
stored in the netcdf files also.

  $runlabel2 = "${testv}_${Chem}_${scenario}_$year\_Trend$iyr_trend";

This has been introduced in rv2_7_1 (in 2007, when introducing a lot of "shipping" countries)
Should affect mostly (only?) global runs.

Derived_ml:

  SURF_ppbC_VOC added in Derived_ml.
  Older Setup_VOC code moved into Setups()

My_Derived_ml : SURF_ppbC_VOC added

ModelConstants_ml : re-arranged to put FFULLDOM.. and RUNDOMAIN
  closer together - will hopefully help to stop errors (e.g. missing
  rough.dat) caused by mis-matched domain sizes.

Biogenics_ml:   EmisNat array added to store emissions

Derived_ml:  processing of EmisNat and SumSnapEmis added with
            NatEmis and SnapEmis types.

            dt_scale now changed to logical. If set true
            the outputs are mutliplied by dt_advec*scale, if
            false just by scale.

            Some tidy-ups

Emissions_ml : SnapEmis processing added

GridValues_ml:  Array GridArea_m2 added  ( = GRIDWIDTH_M*GRIDWIDTH_M*xmd(i,j)


OwnDataTypes_ml: dt_scale now changed to logical.

Setup_1d_ml:  EmisNat processing added


PFT (plant-functional-type)/LPJ changes:

DO3SE_ml: more debug options

DryDep_ml -  Call SetLandUse moved to Unimd.f90
             Possibility of LU_cdf removed for now

LandDefs_ml - added %has_lpj and %pft to LandType defs and
              Inputs_LandDefs.csv

Landuse_ml - uses LandPFTs - just for preliminary testing and
             comparison so far. Many debug statements.

(Peter:)Bug in ReadField_CDF (NetCDF_ml) : did not work if file is not 1 degree resolution

Bug-fix - added HONO dry dep into system (was missing)

Needs attention: Shoud give 2nd look to molwt for PPM25_FIRE

*** Main change **** (Works with EmChem09 only so far!!)

Added grouping-ability to GenChem, which now extends CM_ChemSpecs_ml
with e.g.:

 integer, public, parameter, dimension(2) :: &
             PMCO_GROUP     = (/ PNO3,PPMCO /)

  integer, public, parameter, dimension(2) :: &
             SOX_GROUP     = (/ SO2,SO4 /)
..
  integer, public, parameter, dimension(4) :: &
             SIA_GROUP     = (/ SO4,PNO3,ANH4,ANO3 /)

  integer, public, parameter, dimension(6) :: &
             PM25_GROUP     = (/ SO4,ANH4,ANO3,PPM25,PPM25_FIRE,SSFI /)

! ------- Dry dep      species ------------------
  integer, public, parameter, dimension(6) :: &
               DDEP_OXNGROUP = (/ HNO3,PAN,NO2,ANO3,MPAN,PNO3 /)
  integer, public, parameter, dimension(2) :: &
               DDEP_SOXGROUP = (/ SO2,SO4 /)
  integer, public, parameter, dimension(2) :: &
               DDEP_RDNGROUP = (/ NH3,ANH4 /)

These "groups" are to be "use"d in the rest of Unimod,  so that one
doesn't have to hard code the indices separately.  btw I haven't added
a PM10 group, since that is the sum of PM25 and PMCO. We should think
how to code some of these supergroups to avoid uncessessary operations
in the model.

I have just managed to re-instate one of the older groups so far,
SIA which is now SURF_ug_SIA. Other groups, e.g. PM25 can be
quickly added following this pattern though.

Background: defining such "groups" in the GenIn.species file and letting
Genchem handle them automatically has many advantages.  Not least, we can
change chemical scheme without breaking the code or making errors. For
example, the old code for PM25 defined just a few species. In future
we may want to add seveal new species such as OC, EC, from fires, or
SOA. Or we may want to use a carbon-bond scheme or CRI.

The principal being aimed at is that GenChem needs to know about the
chemistry, Unimod shouldn't.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_6  Peter  Mar 12th  2010

Advection_ml (PhyChem_ml):
Use always the advecdiff_poles routines. (until now it was only used in the global runs,
in other runs advecdiff was used).
advecdiff will be completely removed later (after a test period to see that we don't need it).

advecdiff_poles is also slightly changed:
no renormaliztion with ps-PT between x, y and vertical advection.
division by max(psi,1.0) instead of psi. NB: bad winddata will not crash the model anymore,
and therefore we won't get any warning.

ForestFire/NetCDF: safer interpolation routine


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_5_5  Dave  Mar 9th  2010

BLPhysics

    - added routines for O'Brien, Jericivic Kz, Seibert Kz and Hmix
    - parameters to switch Kz, Hmnix routines
    - parameters for e.g. USTAR_

    default options give:
      Hmix from Jericevic Rb method
      Pielke/Blackater Kz outside PBL
      Kz from O'Brien for unstable conditions
      Kz from Jericevic/Grisogono for stable conditions

   with DEBUG_BLM true, the log file will compare Hmix and
   Kz from all routines for the debug cell.

Met_ml

  Big rewrite of tiphys, now called BLPhysics

  met_derived now has nt argument (1 or nr as appropriate),

  More documentation at start

  Removed most Kz, Hmix calculations - now done by routines from BLPhysics_ml.

  Code could be optimised further, but is only called every 3 hours so
  should be okay. Should delete 3D Kz though and keep just SigmaKz as
  3-D fields.

MetFields_ml

   - invL_nwp added. Query on limits, also ustar?
   - limit on ustar over land > 0.1 m/s (or MIN_USTAR_LAND)

ModelConstants_ml

    OFFSET_X, OFFSET_Y introduced to make coordinates match
     EMEP or EECCA grids. (Set to zero for EMEP, -35,-11 for EECCA

BLPhysics - several Hmix options added. Results for "TI" physics
      zi checked  and identical to those of tiphys routine. Will

And renaming of wind fields to u_xmj, v_xmi
(Peter's suggestion - these have not really physical meaning, they are actually divided by the mapping factor in the perpendicular direction).

NOTE: The many-year old problem with Ri being calculated with the wrong winds is
still not corrected. I've added some !WAIT marks to relevent bits of the code to
help remind about this.....

  Will move more of tiphys here in future. Currently the model contains some
  code for testing Amela's Hmix ideas. Not used except in DEBUG mode.

AeroVds

ModelConstants: Pref= 101325.0  Reference pressure in Pa

Replaced Pressure expressions from sigma to eta nomenclature in:
Aqueous_ml, DryDep_ml, Sites_ml, Setup_1d_ml, GlobalBCs_ml


And other small changes:

run.pl: link without "ifile" for BIC, so that the script does not check if the file exists:
it can do without local BIC, by interpolating the global BIC file.

ForestFire_ml: use GLOBAL_ForestFireEmis.nc instead of ForestFireEmis.nc. They are equal, but
I prefer to have as many non gridspecific files as possible in DataDir.

Nest_ml: Allow the BC and the IC files to be different. (required by Alvaro). Not tested yet.

3-D My_Derived outputs reinstated using new Deriv system. Now
     have D3_PPB and D3_OTHER possibilities

(+ some small tidy ups,
+ BUG-fix for ugS to ugN concentration outputs (N-compounds)
  in Derived_ml, Dave)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_10 Dave,     5 Dec. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Changes made while implementing clover as an option for Fst outputs
 - also includes some general tidy-ups

AOTx_ml - no real change, but a draft clover growing period added
          as comment

Derived_ml - column data now uses vertical starting level, to allow
           use against mountain sites

EcoSystem_ml - dt_scale added - see below

EmisGet_ml - small tidy up

LandDefs_ml - iLC_grass defined for clover usage

LocalVariables_ml - use FstO3 instead of leaf_o3flux

ModelConstants_ml - Added DEBUG_CLOVER

My_Derived_ml - VPD, FST added to MMC_ possibilities.
                More Fst output.
                dt_scale set

My_DryDep_ml.f90 - outout for ozone flux (FST) added

My_Outputs_ml - examples of landcovermet, e.g. RH_GR

OwnDataTypes - dt_scale added - will inform prog of scalin factor
         needed to get from instantaneous d2_  value to accumulated,
         assuming values multiplied by dt_advec
         e.g. for AOT, we need to multiply by dt_advec/3600.0 to
         get ppb.h, so we set dt_scale = 1.0/3600.0

PhyChem.f90 - small tidy up

StoFlux - clover coding added. Clover pots take their O3 from the
         grassland class (which therefore needs to be set 1st)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_9  Dave,    28 Nov. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

**New** module AOTx_ml.f90 - a place to keep definitions of AOT

CellMet_ml  - ResetSub added to ensure proper reset at start of each i,j
Derived_ml  - small format changes

DryDep_ml - uses METCONC_AT
               remove call to Init_StoFlux, fewer parameters in
          call Add_MosaicOutput

LandDefs_ml - use LandType()%flux_wanted
Landuse_ml  - iam_wheat code removed (not functioning)
LocalVariables - added cano3_ppb, leaf_o3flux, ResetSub
ModelConstants_ml - added DEBUG_STOFLUX
Setup_1d_ml - added my_first_call to limit number of volcano printouts
StoFlux_ml -   uses Sub(iL)%leaf_o3flux %cano3_ppb instead of
               c_hvegppb array
               remove sub Init_StoFlux
TimeDate_ml - added effectivedate here

My_Derived_ml - changed AOT system
                Allow MMAOT, EUAOT
                Added CanopyRH and RH to possible Mosaic outputs
My_DryDep_ml - adapted to new AOT system
               use of lossfrac removed
               tidy up of "select case" options - use of Calc_AOTx
My_Outputs_ml - examples with e.g. VPD_GR, CanopyO3_GR

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_8  Peter,   25 Nov. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Met_ml: does not stop if rh2m is not found, but set it to a meaningless value

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_7   Dave,   19 Nov. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

CellMet_ml - rh2m replaces rh for grid met

Derived_ml, som replaced by somo, SOM by SOMO.

DryDep - zero index allowed for Mosaic_Met, to collect grid-values

My_DryDep - zero index allowed for Mosaic_Met, to collect grid-values

Met_ml  - relative_humidity_2m read from metcdf files (for tests
   and possible replacement of mosaic rh calculation)

Global change, tabs replaced by 4 spaces
(might mess up some code-indentation in a few files. Please fix
when seen!)

pedantic changes for DryDep - removed or commented out (dsVDS)
unused variables.

Re-write of many Derived fields and usage. This work is only
partly complete, and so some "old" derived fields aren't
yet in the new system. Still, many of them need re-thinking
anywa, and many need to be included in a cleaner "SURF_UG"
type approach.

All use an expanded "Deriv" data type,

Derived_ml

   - many simplifications
   - AddDeriv and AddNewDeriv replace AddDef
   - nMosaic, MosaicOutput includes all of what used to be
        nOutDDEP, OutDDep, nOutVg, Out.... etc.

DryDep_ml

    - call to Add_MosaicOutput replaces Add_Vg, Add_RG, Add_LCC

EcoSystem_ml

    - small changes (TXTLEN_UNIT -> TXTLEN_SHORT
    - use of new Deriv for DepEcoSystem

EmisGet_ml:  internal read of MassValue%value changed to MassValue(1)%value to
EmisGet_ml:  internal read of MassValue%value changed to MassValue(1)%value to
  satisfy older gfortran.

My_Derived_ml:

    - use of new MosaicOutput and Deriv type.
    - Note, not all outputs have been converted to new system yet. Just
      commented out for now.

My_DryDep_ml:

    - use of new MosaicOutput and Deriv type.
    - subroutine Add_MosaicOutput replaces Add_Vg, Add_RG, Add_LCC

OwnDataTypes - expand Deriv type, replace print_dep_type with
   print_deriv_type, remove "dep_type"

Sites_ml

    - "hmix" special case removed. Use "HMIX" and "D2D" in My_Outputs instead


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_5   Alvaro, 10 Nov. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

run.pl - corrected bugs introdiced on rv3_4_2

Makefile_titan - small change for linking rule (makedepf90/Depend/.depend)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_4   Peter, 9 Nov. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GridValues_ml.f90,Met_ml.f90,PhyChem_ml.f90: use Pole_included instead of Poles.
Should make the global model work also when NPROCY >2 (but still in an inefficient way).

Nest_ml : use dayssince1900 for nesting.

run.pl: linked monthly gridded emissions if GLOBAL

                 real:: USso2trend=1.0,USnoxtrend=1.0,USnh4trend=1.0

NetCDF_ml - time units "time at end of period" for hourly output

Met_ml - ensure positive precipitation

Nest_ml - nested input/output on FORECAST mode:
          Read nested input (all ADV variables) at start of the run
          and write nested output (all ADV variables) one/two date-times.
          The first nested output will be used to start next day forecast.
          The second nested output can be used for NMC statistics.

Unimod.f90 - open only output netCDF files if needed
           - hourly output for hour "zero" on FORECAST mode
           - write 'modelrun.finished' file to flag the end of the FORECAST
           - nested input/output on FORECAST mode
           - pedantic: remove unused variables fileName & iotyp

       - add Forecast mode (CWF) and FORECAST grid

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4_1    Peter  6 Nov 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New routine ReadField_CDF , which reads a global lat-lon file with data and
interpolates into subdomain. Note that all CPUs read the same file simultaneously.
In the future this can be developed into explicit parallel reads.
This routine will soon be used for reading forest fires emissions.

Met_ml: more robust definition of gl_stagg (staggered longitude)

run.pl: link to global forest fire emission file.

Small corrections to ZCM_EmChem09. EXTRA_ITER=1 in Solver_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_4beta Dave, Robert  5 Nov 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Signficant change in handling of emissions.  New chemistry.
-----------------------------------------------------------

1) Emissions

No need to specify in advance NEMIS_PLAIN, NEMIS_SPLIT etc. Instead,
the code (EmisGet) figures out from the new emissplit.defaults.xxxx
files how many species each emission consists of. Every pollutant now
has to have an emissplit.defaults file, with headers.  Eliminates a lot
of code and confusion (IMHO) :-)

The emissplit files also contain a MASS_ASSUMED variable. Set to
zero if the code can just figure out the emissions from the real
species. For NOx as NO2, we set 46, for SOx as SO2, set 64.

My_Emis_ml --- ** deleted **

EmisDef - now simpler. Define your emission files here.

EmisGet_ml now does more work, but doesn't need to worry about PLAIN
versus SPLIT.

Setup_1d_ml
Setup_1dfields_ml

run.pl  - now uses $SplitDir = $DATA_LOCAL/SPLITS_NOV2009/BASE_MAR2004
(CLE case not done yet)

Io_Progs_ml - small improvements (for safety)
RunChem_ml  - small changes
Solver_ml - small change (Fgas moved)
Timefactors - mainly use of NEMIS_FILES
Volcanos_ml  --NOTE - used hard-coded MW=64 here. Ran out of energy..
(and such info should be in Volcano input file)


2) Chemistry
ZCM_EmChem09 introduced. Uses rate-updates fro Robert/Conny (2008 work)
plus other improvements arising from chemistry comparison with
Garry Hayman. This '09 version is now the default chemistry.

Plus (Alvaro)
My_Derived_ml - made compatable with older gfortran through use of
tag_name (gfortran or gcc bug, solved for those with Ubuntu Jaunty
of Karmic, affects Hardy, in which   "AAA" // "BBB" wasn't accepted for
strings in AddArray.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3_3 Dave,  24  Oct. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Log.changes : all equals signs changed to xxxx, as cvs seems to
be confusing these lines with conflict indicators. Will have
caused some strange lines where equations had a real =, but life
will be easier from now on.

EmisGet_ml - reformat of vocsplit write-out

SmallUtils_ml - errmsg added to AddArray

My_Derived - errmsg in AddArray, and CheckStop - prevents wanted_deriv2d
             exceeding MAX_NUM_DERIV2D (x200 which is a lot anyway!)
           - also just use HNO3 by default in NNDRYDEP -
           - and SO2, SO4 in WETDEP -
           - explicit write_condition added

My_Outputs - all SHL species by default for sites

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3_2 Dave,  18  Oct. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

QRCISOP replaced by QRCC5H8 for consistency across chemical schemes
rcbio changed to simple 1-d array (rcbio(NBVOC), public from Setup_ml
setup_rcemis now adds the biogenic rcbio() to the posisbly anthropogenic
rcemis(QRCC5H8,:) arrays. CM_Reactions uses the latter.

CM_ files changed to reflect C5H8

Small formatting changes (numerous in CM files)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3_1 Peter, 12  Oct. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Bug in dayssince1900 (NetCDF_ml). Timestamps were wrong

Dave - re-committed My_DryDep, My_Derived mls, hopefully.  (Some confusion
in cvs here.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3 Dave, 11  Oct. 2009 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New *EcoSystem_ml* introduced to include definitions for EcoDep
  new netcdf outputs of e.g. Area_Grid_km2, Area_Conif_Frac

-> CHanges in Derived_ml, My_Derived, Unimod.f90, My_DryDep, DryDep
    (maybe others...)

RO2POOL introduced in Solver to cope with CRI chemistry

Makefile_gfortran added. Code compiles with stricted flags (although
  with lots of warning!)

 !!!!****** ZD_ACID removed ****!!!!
 Functionality must be created through GenChem system now.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3beta5, Garry/Dave,  9  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

Changes from Garry to enable g95 compilation - mainly needing lengths
of strings in initialisations to be the same.

My_DryDep_ml
My_Outputs_ml
My_Derived_ml

I also made some minor tidy-ups in My_Derived_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3beta4, Dave,  9  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

Changes to ease compilation with gfortran, and execution on PC.

Derived_ml.f90 :  f_3d -associated code changed to make it easier to skip
                  this. Needed for PC runs (at least on my PC):

                  Some unused arguments removed also from functions


Also some unused variables (spotted by pedantic gfortran option) removed
   Timing_ml, Unimod.f90, Ammonium_ml, GridValues_ml, NetCDF_ml, PhyChem_ml,
   Sites_ml


Note that in Solver_ml, EXTRA_ITER is set to 3, not 1. This is for safety while
testing different chemical schemes, and can hopefully be reduced back to 1 soon.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3beta3, Dave,  7  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

Derived_ml: AOTs restored, to some extent anyway.
    AOTs and fluxes now treated in same VEGO3 methodology

My_Derived_ml - lots of changes to get AOT, VEGO3 etc.

My_DryDep_ml  - lots of changes to get AOT, VEGO3 etc.

ChemFunctions_ml: kmt3 added

EmisGet - small extra debug output

RunChem_ml - removed QRCISOP from printout line. Not is all CM versions now.

+fixed some forgotten commits from last-version (My_files weren't updated
in ZD_OZONE, and OwnDataTypes_ml)

Many changes now marked with !Oct09 or !DSGC. The comments mess up the code
and will be cleaned out in a revision ort two.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3beta2, Dave,  5  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

GenChem enabled EMEP chemistries, almost done?

New file-labelling system and directories:

ZCM_EmChem03 - contains chemical-mechanism (CM) files for EMEP 2003
chemistry vocsplit files are also chemistry dependent, so for now we
keep them with the code.

ZCM_EmChem03 directory:
----------------------
CM_BoundaryConditions.inc  CM_Reactions1.inc  vocsplit.defaults.EmChem03
CM_ChemRates_ml.f90        CM_Reactions2.inc  vocsplit.special.EmChem03
CM_ChemSpecs_ml.f90        CM_VOC_MW.inc
CM_DryDep.inc              CM_VOC_QRC.inc


The above replaces many of the  My_ files. The latter are now mainly used
to specify desired outputs, and the aerosol schemes. Thus, ZCM_EmChem03
gives the chemistry, ZD_OZONE gives whatever else is needed, and
ZD_ACID should be deleted in the near future. (ZD_ACID should be
replaced by a ZCM_ directory for acid chemistry. Somebody would need
to check over how O3 and stuff are handled though).

Thus, from Unimod.rv3_3,do:
   cp ZCM_EmChem03/CM*
   cp ZD_OZONE/My* .

GenXXXX -> ChemXXXX

In the code, "GenXXX" modules are replaced with ChemXXX modules, thus
GenSpec_adv_tot now becomes ChemSpec_adv_tot. Seemed more logical.

Note, CM_Reactions1 replaces My_FastReactions, CM_Reactions2 replaces
My_SlowReactions since the distinction was really between chemicals that
needed to be in the iteration scheme or not (as they reacted further),
not just speed.


Chemical schemes can be swapped with the mk.GenChem script, which will
be added in CVS somewhere very soon. So far have one "working" sheme (EmChem03),
and one almost-working, EmChem09. Will soon add carbon-bond, CRI, and others

More  changes to make it easier to swap chemistry (coming soon...) :

  My_Derived_ml - uses groups from ChemGroups_ml, removes hard-coded OXN etc.

  My_DryDep_ml - now includes "CM_DryDep.inc" from GenChem's ZCM_EmChem03 directory

  CM_ .... files now from GenChem's ZCM_EmChem03 directory

Plus:

  COLUMN-data added to Derived and My_Derived_ml, simplified calculation

  **New** OwnDataTypes_ml created to store user-defined types. Mainly
  intended to make My_* files shorter. Used so for dep_type, Deriv, SOA-VBST

  Causes modifications (and small tidy-ups) to:
      Derived_ml, My_Derived_ml, NetCDF_ml, Nest_ml

Status and ToDo
-----------------
I think that the GenChem-associated changes are basically done (though of
course I am sure changes will be needed!).

The code still needs work to recover some outputs, notably AOT40, which were
omitted during the changes to Derived and My_Derived (rv3_2_13 onwards).
All gas-phase and deposition outputs look fine, afaics.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_3beta, Dave,  1  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

 GenChem enabled EMEP chemistries
 Caveat: New code seems to work fine, but the numerics  of all rv3_2.. are
 slightly less optimised compared to rv3_1 versions (I removed Peter's
 hard-coded linking of equations in My_FastReactions). The linking
 could be re-introduced for a SR version, but for normal use I recommend
 testing with different chemistry time-steps. (So far my tests show a
 very stable system though)

Introduced ** new directory :: :

 ZD_EmChem03 -  to keep EMEP 2003 chemistry outputs from GenChem.

More  changes to make it easier to swap chemistry (coming soon...) :

  My_BoundaryConditions_ml.f90 **removed**. Some code moved to BoundaryConditions_ml

  My_BoundaryConditions.inc **added**.  Will vary with chemical scheme.

  My_MassBudget **removed**. Equivalent (simpler) lines added to My_Emis_ml
     and Setup_1d_ml

  My_ChemSpecs - module GenGroups_ml **added**, provides:

     OXNGROUP x (/ NO,NO2,PAN,MPAN,NO3,N2O5,HNO3,PNO3,ANO3 /)

     DDEP_OXNGROUP x (/ HNO3,NO2,PAN,MPAN,PNO3 /)

   ... and avoids having to hard-code these in rest of code. Please use!

  My_Outputs_ml  "&" added to please gfortran

  Sites_ml - modifed to make use of OXNGROUP

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_31, Dave,  1  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

Some changes to make it easier to swap chemistry (coming soon...) :

  Derived_ml - hard-coding for CH3CHO, MAX3DADV of CH3COO2, PHNO3 removed

  EmisGet_ml - extra safety printouts for  VOC speciation

  OutputChem_ml - uses MasterProc and more debug output with My_DEBUG


Plus....   Some changes to solve small problems spotted by gfortran:

  BoundaryConditions_ml.f90 - debug_proc removed from ModelConstants use

  CellMet_ml.f90: -1* instead of -Grid%Hd

  GridValues_ml.f90: changes of real, integer defintions

  NetCDF_ml.f90: small re-code

  ReadField_ml.f90: Use .eqv., not xx in any (cell_set .eqv. .false. )

  Solver.f90: double-def of rct removed

  My_ChemRates_ml.f90: rcmisc line split. Not sure why gfortgran complained, except
    it doesn't seem to like long lines


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_30, Dave,    1  Oct. 2009xxxxxx

Bug-fix!
My_Derived_ml index problem fixed. This bug didn't affect the model runs,
but caused the wrong output in DDEP_SOX etc. Introduced in
rv3_2_11. New code seems to work fine, but more checks would be useful

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_29, Peter,   17 Sep. 2009xxxxxx

removed -mieee-fp from Makefile and Makefile_stallo
This options made the floating point operations ieee compliant, but are now slowing down the computation
quite a lot, and even more (30% diff) with the next intel compiler version (11.1, to come on stallo in October)
If one wish to compare results between diferent machines (stallo and njord for example it may be useful
to put the option back)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_28, Dave,   16 Sep. 2009xxxxxx

My_Reactions omitted - code moved into Solver_ml
My_SlowReactions.inc added

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_27, Peter,  10 Sep. 2009xxxxxx

Changes to comply with the rotated spherical projections and new definition/units for time:
now in days since year 1900. The seconds used earlier do not run after 2037 or so and we
need to run later for climate studies.
NBNB: if you have postprocesing scripts which make use of the date read from the netcdf
files, make sure to update these!

NetCDF_ml and Met_ml are changed

Dave changed Functions_ml also, to use sin instead of sind (for gfortran
compliance), and removed 360 term.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_26, Dave,  4 Sep. 2009xxxxxx

INTERIM version - the concentrations look fine, but for some
reason WDEP, DDEP is different to older (rv3_1) results. Needs
investigating!
(Differences *not* due to changes here, likely those from
some revisions ago)

Main change: My_Chem files all come  *directly* from GenChem output
Some small change in reactions introduced here, but doesn't affect
air concentrations very much.

My_ChemSpecs_ml
My_FastReactions

*** note, since these files are from GenChem, we have lost some of
the optimisations which Peter introduced. This can one day be
coded into GenChem, or done by hand again.
   On the oter hand, GenChem got rid of some of the bugs introduced
by hand-coding ;-)

Solver_ml:  use NUM_INITCHEM, DT_INITCHEM etc., to try to make
  timestep values easier to change. Values printed out to IO_LOG


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_25, Dave, 11 July 2009xxxxxx

Some changes to make the code "safer" I hope, after being caught out by
unexpected input files when changing domain.

Input files expected:  Now expect rough.dat and Inputs.2BVOC
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Met_ml now requires rough.dat, not rough.170. The new "fill_needed"
parameter is used to ensure that this data fills the grid. Unlike
the zero sized rough.170 in the EECCA data-directory ;-)

Biogenics_ml -  now looks for Inputs.2BVOC, not Inputs.BVOC. the
reason is tat the terpene emission factors were all -999.999 in
the EECCA directory. No problem for standard runs, but a major
problem for SOA runs.
Now checks that terpene emission factor is positive, at least if NBVOC > 1


Io_Progs_ml - extra debug stuff

ModelConstants_ml - extra lines for EECCA domains, and more debug options

ReadField_ml  - optional "fill_needed" parameter added to
readfield_r and readfield_i routines.  CheckStop will stop the run if
fill_needed is true, if the domain isn't filled.

New Inputs.2BVOC file created for EECCA

run.pl - now has $GRID which can be EMEP, GLOBAL, EECCA etc.

MassBudget_ml: small format change

Changes to My_Outputs_ml.f90 and Output_hourly.f90 to solve bug with units
(ugSm3 etc.). General ADVugXX used for all mass-based outputs in Outputs_ml,
with units to be chosen in My_Outputs_ml.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_22, Peter 30th June 2009xxxxxx

GridValues_ml, NetCDF_ml, et_ml:
Defined "rotated_latitude_longitude" projection following CF-1.0 convention.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_21, Dave, 24-26th xxxxxx

found_ind2d, found_ind3d added to Derived_ml to esnure that we
don't try to define the same variable twice.

Comma removed in GLobal_ml, needed to compile

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_20, Peter, 24th June 2009xxxxxx

GridValues_ml:
Added the general case in lb2ij, which gives (i,j) values (as real numbers) given
longitude and latitude for any grid projection.
Used for sites/sondes given as lonlat.

Function_ml, Nest_ml:
Moved great_circle_distance into Functions_ml.


Note: The new default compiler on stallo (ifort 11.0), gives a segmentation fault
on line 711 in NetCDF_ml, when compiled with debug options. After closer look, this is most probably due to
a bug in the compiler...


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_19, Peter, 2nd June 2009xxxxxx

Small change for compatibility with rotated spherical projection (H20)

Met_ml:
-180<gl_glob<180

NetCDF:
Compatibility with GLOBAL_BIC (see rv3_2_4)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_18, Agnes, 1st June 2009xxxxxx

GlobalBCs_ml:

update of Mace-Head ozone values, now with average from 1998-2007. Also
recalculated the 2006 and 2007 Mace Head values with the new 10-year
average.

Commented out the +3 (4.5) ppb scaling for future years (2010 and later),
so the 1998-2007 10-year average will be used for these years.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_17, Peter, 28th May 2009xxxxxx

Solver.f90:
nchem is now set to 10 when dt_advecx600

Advection_ml:
Larger dt_advec for fine resolution

Functions_ml, NetCDF_ml:
Move "inside_1234" into Functions_ml

My_Reactions.inc:
We go back to the "toiter(k)" loop; with the new compiler this is the fastest (though only a few %)
and it is neater too.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_16, Agnes, 20th May 2009xxxxxx

MaceHead correction for 2007 added.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_15, Dave,  20th May 2009xxxxxx

Functions_ml : troe removed, and moved (as troeInlog) to:

New module: ChemFunctions_ml - with troe, RiemerN2O5, kaero functions

Added modules: My_ChemSpecs_ml My_ChemRates_ml

  - split from old My_Chem_ml, to make use of GenChem easier
  - RiemerN2O5, kaero now done in ChemFunctions
  - tabulation of rate constants switched off for now.
    ( Surprisingly, ** No CPU cost **. Time for chemistry almost
      identical )

Removed modules: My_Chem_ml,  OrganicAerosol_ml

    (the latter not needed, as we have SOA_ml)

Setup_1d_ml, Setup_1dfields_ml
   - removed Rimer stuff, some re-organisation because of My_Chem changes

Solver_ml - has EXTRA_ITER to allow
            ONLY_NIGHT code removed

Unimod.f90 - no need for Init_mychem



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_14, Dave,  16th May 2009xxxxxx

Changes to make switch to global model easier, plus some tidy-ups

IS_GLOBAL added to ModelConstants_ml

Emissions_ml : sets MonthlyEmis x IS_GLOBAL
  (keeps all Global - EMEP changes in ModelConstants)
   Tidy-up

run.pl: My $GLOBAL added as switch
   sitesLL.dat, sondesLL.dat added as defaults in $DataDir - suggest
    only use long/lat files in future.

My_Outputs_ml
   removed D2_AFST... etc., and dependency on Derived

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_13, Dave,  15th May 2009xxxxxx

Working changes::: AOT outputs have been commented out. Will re-appear
soon!

LandDefs_ml
New functions for Check_LandCoverPresent added.

My_Derived_ml
  AFST now dealt with using "OutXX" system, as for VG, RG

My_Derived_ml
  AFST now dealt with using "OutXX" system, as for VG, RG
  Gets rid of iam_wheat, D2_AFST... etc. type indices
  check_vals now not needed.:wq

Derived_ml
  -- more changes to cope with AFST and Out variables

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_12b, Peter  14th May 2009xxxxxx

ReadField, Landuse, Met_ml:
Use landuse to define nwp_sea when rough file is missing


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_12, Peter  14th May 2009xxxxxx



ReadField_ml:
Optional parameter when the field is not needed

Met_ml:
rough is set to 0 if not needed
snow is not required when read from metdata

Sites:
sites.dat and sondes.dat are not required.
(the code was hanging when this happened)

Rsurface_ml: if ice is missing, but sdepth is present, take sdepth instead of snow.(IS THIS OK?)
    if ( .not. foundsdepth)then
       fsnowxG%snow !snow from climatology files, 1 or 0
    endif

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_11, Dave,  14th May 2009xxxxxx

Changes to allow for possibility of new landuse codes, or of
old landuse codes (e.g. "CF" not being recognied with new
systems)

Unimod.f90 - Init_Derived now moved after Init_landuse, so that
  the My_derived code knows about the available Land_codes

My_Derived_ml - check added for MET_LCS to see if the LC actually
  exists. If not, nOutMET will be zero. Note that for other
  outputs the code will crash if a non-existant land-code is given.
  The user can keep it working by only havinbg "Grid" in the arrays,
  e.g. for RG_LCS x (/ "Grid" /)

  Also, some slight tidy-up to reduce clutter

SmallUtils:  find_index again returns NOT_FOUND (-999) instead of 1
    also, trim() added to txt strings

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_10, Peter  13th May 2009xxxxxx

First version of a grid flexible Landuse input

GridValues and Met_ml: defined gb_stagg and gl_stagg (staggered lon and lat)

NetCDF:
 Read_Local_Inter_CDF, to read and interpoalte landuse from raw data.
Under construction!

Landuse_ml: call to Read_Local_Inter_CDF when Input.Landuse is not found

Replaced all NLANDUSE with NLANDUSEMAX: used for array declaration and is the max allowed,
NLanduse_DEF is the actual number of landuse defined.
DO3SE_ml,DryDep,LandDef,StoFlux_ml,NetCDF,LocalVariables_ml

LandDefs_ml: NLanduse_DEF number of landuse defined
NLANDUSE_EMEPx19. To check data from Input.Landuse.
StoFlux_ml: use NLanduse_DEF instead of NLANDUSE.
DryDep_ml: InitDO3SE called only if not already read by Read_Local_Inter_CDF

ModelConstants:NLANDUSE    x 23 ! MAXIMUM Number of land use types

SmallUtils_ml: NB: provisory!!
!    Index x  NOT_FOUND
    Index x  1

run.pl: link to landuseGLC2000_INT1.nc

NB: The new landuses system is still under developement.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_9, Dave  8th May 2009xxxxxx

Derived_ml, My_Derived_ml:

SURF_UG_C, SURF_UG and SURF_PPB added

Also write_debug routine added in Derived_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_8, Dave  8th May 2009xxxxxx

Derived_ml, My_Derived_ml

Start of move to simpler system, where wanted surface concentrations
can be specified with their index, e.g to get ug(N)/m3 NO2
use SURF_UG_N x (/ ...., NO2, .... /)
 - removes need for character "D2_NO2" and index D2_NO2 and allows
Derived to be specified with simple loop over SURF_UG_N. Similar
system in place for SURF_UG_S, and will later implement SURF_PPB


Derived, My_DryDep
AOT30 outputs removed. (Whole AOT system should also be replaced. Usage
of e.g. D2_AOT30 in My_DryDep caused hard-to-find bug in d_2d when AOT30 removed
from Derived system)

My_Chem_ml   - use PPM25 instead of PM25 for primary  PM25. Ditto for PMco
My_WetDep_ml -  ditto
Sites_ml     -  ditto

My_DryDep_ml
   AOT30 stuff removed. (Hard-coded D2_AOT30 variables caused hard-to-find
    problem in d_2d index. Hard-coding of numbers proved bad once again....)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_7, Dave  5th May 2009xxxxxx

** Bugs found and fixed **
-  bugs were in old  My_WetDep_ml code, but luckily not for
anything we have reported. wepdeppm25 and wdeppmco were wrong.
WDEP_NH3 and WDEP_aNH4 were mixed up, but WDEP_RDN was okay.


Aqueous_ml - loop over SO4LIKE once wet dep loss rate for SO4
  calculated.
  uses wdeploss frm MassBudget instead of old sumloss
  now sets wdeploss using indices, e.g. wdeploss(SO2)

Io_ml - added IO_DEBUG to allow printout to separate file (just fort.26 for now)

My_WetDep_ml:
  use array SO4LIKE to contain other fine particles
  now sets wdeploss using indices, e.g. wdeploss(SO2)
  (slower I guess, but clearer and safer!)

Runchem_ml:
  modified to use new WetDeposition, SOA_ml
  - pretty messy with DEVUG statements. Will tidy up another day

SOA_ml:
  debug_flag added

(These changes are a step towards SOA, where many species will need
to be handled by the dep routines, but all as SO4-like.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_6, Dave  4th May 2009xxxxxx
Emissions_ml
Replacement of if(mexx0) with  if(MasterProc)

Replaced the calls to MPI_ABORT with CheckStop calls. I hope these do the
same thing, and they help to keep the code shorter. Look for "!dsx" bits
to check this. (We can delete these lines once we are sure all is okay).

ModelConstants_ml
-- added extra DEBUG constants

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_5, Peter 4th May 2009xxxxxx
NetCDF_ml:
Bug: Removed a test which stops the code.

run.pl:
defined($country_nums{$cc}) and ALL x> 0 for selecting all countries



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_4, Peter 22nd April 2009xxxxxx

Flexible BIC:
If the "Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions.nc" file is not found, it will interpolate the data from
"GLOBAL_Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions.nc".
"GLOBAL_Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions.nc" should be written with global run results (not yet done).

NetCDF_ml:
 GetCDF is now very general, it does not assume anything about the dimensions. You can use this to read any Netcdf file.
new routine "Read_Inter_CDF". It reads data from a lon lat grid and interpolates to the model grid. (not in parallel, should be called by mex0 only)

run.pl: link to "GLOBAL_Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions.nc"


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_3, Peter 3rd April 2009xxxxxx

Updates for the Global model

Solver.f90
nchemx15 for gridwidth larger than 60km.
Still this value should be tested.

Met_ml:
Improved default value for sdot.

Emissions_ml:
Introduced a "MONTHLY_GRIDEMIS" parameter for easier use in global runs.

My_Chem_ml:
species%sulphurx0 for ISONO3,ISNI and ISNIR (bug)

Landuse_ml:
NLUMAX x 19

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_2, Dave 27th Mar 2009xxxxxx

Some small tidy-ups, and extensions:

Country_ml:  IC_INTSHIPS x 350 added for TNO emissions

EmisDef_ml: extended to deal with TNO EC/OC emissions

EmisGet_ml: extended to allow for more emission entries

Emissions_ml: tidy up of DEBUG stuff.

ModelConstants_ml: more DEBUG added

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2_1 20th Mar 2009xxxxxx

Various DEBUG variables changed, See new logicals in ModelConstants_ml

Sites_ml  - ascii output set to 10 columns rather than 8 (easier to
count!). Also, outputs excluded when site is on domain boundary

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MAJOR CHANGES SINCE RV3_1

Done - rv3_2 now has new co-dep routine, new aerosol deposition, and
 more land-cover output possibilities in Derived. See various beta
 changes below...., this has been a long process!

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta18 Dave, 16th Mar 2009xxxxxx
(Skipped 16,17 ...)

Major change in aerosol deposition calculations, designed to simplify.
Aero_Vds_ml replaces Aero_Rb_ml, and will serve as a collection point
of alternative algorithms. For this version use a simple formula ('GPF'x
generalised Petroff fit) for forests
derived from Petroff et al's papers, as function of ustar, SAI and invL.
Use Nemitz(2004) for all else. SubMet also changed to reflect findings of
various ustar tests against CarboEurope data and offline testing.

Also note new way of specifying DEBUG in ModelConstants - applied
to just a few routines so far. (Intended to make if faster to
switch debuggung on and off, and to save those occasions where
MY_DEBUG in SubMet_ml didn't help as the poor user had forgotten
that this one needed DEBUG in RUnChem_ml switched on too. (Otherwise
debug_flag was never set true)

Derived system modified again, to allow landuse-specif met
params to be output, just invL and ustar so far. Still should
be improved and made more efficient - a work in progress.

Module changes:

CellMet

  Grid%is_allNWPsea added -  used to identify all-sea squares

  Following Branko's comments, we limit u* to a physically plausible value,
  0.1 m/s to prevent numerical problems in stable BLs

CoDep_ml - just write "First CoDep" for MasterProc

Derived_ml - makes use of  DEBUG_DERIVED, and OutMET added. Also
            USTAR_NWP.

DryDep_ml
 Large changes!
 replace Aero_Rb with Aero_Vds, and use new formula for forests,
 Wesely for all else. Settling velocity calc moved in Aero_vds_ml
 also.  Limit settling velocity (Vs) to 2 cm/s

LocalVariables_ml.f90
  logical :: is_allNWPsea   !  Only sea in grid-square

ModelConstants_ml
  new DEBUG_RUNCHEM etc.

Rsurface_ml -  max 10 s/m for HNO3 re-introduced

Runchem_ml - uses DEBUG_RUNCHEM

SubMet_ml
   Many changes - Increased iterations for neutral, unstable,
   just one for stable.

   We restrict z0 to max 0.5m, since comparison with CarboEurope
   results shows that this provides the best u* values for forests.

    ! We use the same restriction on z0 as in Berge, 1990 (Tellus,42B,389-407)
        Sub(iL)%z0 x max( Sub(iL)%z0 ,1.5e-5)

    Uses DEBUG_SUBMET

Rsurface_ml
 - reimplement Vg limitation for HNO3. 10 cm/s max is enough anyway!

run.pl
  New input files, shorter veg in general
 $ifile{"$DataDir/Inputs_LandDefs.csv_05.12.2008"} x "Inputs_LandDefs.csv";
 $ifile{"$DataDir/Inputs_LandDefs.csv_25.02.2009"} x "Inputs_LandDefs.csv";

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived
  changes for new met outputs
  tidy up for OutVg, OutRG

ZD_OZONE/My_DryDep
    Uses DEBUG_MY_DRYDEP
    OutMET added


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta15 Hilde, 25th Feb 2009xxxxxx
New run.pl with:
   Inputs_DO3SE.csv_25.02.2009 (Surface resistance for RgsS for ice set to 1000). No effect on results
   Inputs_LandDefs.csv_25.02.2009  - reduced height for forests and med. Scrub. Will change results

   SubMet_ml:
      revised ustar, invL, with more iterations for unstable
      z0 limit changed slightly, to match Berge 1990 value
      CellMet-ml -in troduced 0.1 m/s limit on ustar for Grid%ustar

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta14 Dave/Svetlana, 11th Feb 2009xxxxxx

SubMet_ml - bug corrected on z0 for sea-areas (big effect?!)
    new (still experimental) limit on forest z0 x 0.5m

PhysicalConstants_ml - Charnock set to 0.0144 instead of 0.036


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta13 Peter,   4th Feb 2009xxxxxx


Met_ml:
New method of deriving sigma_dot when it is missing.
Hopefully this can be a usable alternative, which will avoid most of the prostprosessing
problems of the metdata (mass filtering etc).

Will not changes results in case sigma_dot is found.

Small change in Output_hourly (only debug printing).
            if ( hr_out(ih)%type(1:3) xx "ADV" ) then



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta12 Dave,   3rd Feb 2009xxxxxx

MasterProc introduced in:
  ModelConstants
  Par_ml
  LandDefs
  Io_Progs_ml

 Use "if (MasterProc)" instead of "if (me xx 0)", which needs use ModelConstants
instead of use Par_ml. Easier for box-model type codes.

Also:

LandDefs_ml made F-complaint
PhysicalConstants_ml: R removed, only use RGAS_KG
  Met_ml: R replaced by RGAS_KG.
(I think single letter parameters are too hard to search for.)

SubMet_ml   made F-complaint

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta11 Hilde,   29nd Jan 2009xxxxxx
Bug in Output_hourly.f90:
Units wrong for case ( "ADVugm3" ).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta10 Peter,   22nd Jan 2009xxxxxx

Bug in Met_ml introduced 20th Nov 2008: when a metfield was not found the routine GetCDF_short
returns without closing the file.
If the number of open files exceeds 4096, the program will stop.
No differences if you haven't noticed.

Bug in Log.changes: Jan 2008 was Jan 2009 :-)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta9 Hilde,   20th Jan 2009xxxxxx

DAY_NIGHTx0.6 in Timefactors_ml for sector 10. This means that the agricultural emissions will be 1.4/0.6 times larger in day time than in night.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta8 Dave,   12th Jan 2009xxxxxx

fixed bug in CoDep, which I thought had been fixed in beta7 :-(

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta7 Dave,   12th Jan 2009xxxxxx

CoDep has a small bug-fix (for IRHx0, F4) and more debug options
 + includes Hilde's bug-fix for MAX_SN

Derived_ml + My_Derived_ml
  now has OutRG as merge of OutR and OutG terms

DryDep + My_DryDep

landuse-specific, *and* grid-average, deposition (Vg),  resistance (R)
and conductance (G) variables now stored in "Mosaic_xx" arrays in
DryDep. Using landcover indexx0 gives grid average

Deleted old arrays, Grid_Vg_ref, Vg_ref_iL etc.

DRYDEP_CALC  renamed to DRYDEP_GASES
NDRYDEP_CALC renamed to NDRYDEP_GASES
NDRYDEP_TOT  renamed to NDRYDEP_CALC - ie back to original intention

Area(:) renamed to EcoArea



OutR, outG merged into outRG
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta6 Hilde,  17th Dec 2008xxxxxx

Derived_ml: small change (only effect is that less 'warnings' written out, there was a problem with undef values)
CoDep_ml:a_SN_24hrxso2/nh3,a_SNxso2/nh3, both capped at so2/nh3x3.0, Switch off debug flag
Rsurface_ml: fsnow x2.0 *G%sdepth/Sdmax (before G%sdepth/Sdmax)

Changing a_SN_24hr from 0.6*so2/nh3 to so2/nh3 has only minor effect on so2/nh3 in 2006
(average increase from 0.8 to 0.81, 1% to 3% higher than obs)

Changing fsnow from G%sdepth/Sdmax to 2.0*G%sdepth/Sdmax
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta5 Hilde,   8th Dec 2008xxxxxx
CoDep_ml: cap on minimum value on nh3conc (to avoid numerical problems
when nh3 conc is zero - like it is in the beginning)

Derived_ml: Outputted so2nh3_ratio capped at 3 to avoid unrealistic values in the average.
Anyway so2nh3ratio_24hr is effectively capped at 3 in the Rns calculation, so this will show
how it is used.

DryDep_ml: changed dimensions
My_DryDep_ml: small change in output for Rns since it is not defined for all landuses always

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta4 Hilde,   8th Dec 2008xxxxxx
PhyChem_ml: call to make so2nh3_24hr! Was forgotten committed, so so2nh3 was
effectively set to 0 everywhere after new CoDep routine added...

run.pl: New links Inputs_LandDefs.csv_05.12.2008 and Inputs_DO3SE.csv_05.12.2008
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_2beta3 Hilde,   5th Dec 2008xxxxxx
added Snow and so2nh3_24hr to old output system and committed Derived and My_Derived again.

Change version number to reflect that this model version has new
deposition scheme compared to rv3_1 series...
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_1_10  Hilde,   4th Dec 2008xxxxxx
Met_ml: read snow,ice, foundsdepth, foundice
CellMet_ml : use sdepth,ice snow from Met_ml
Chem_ml: defined  so2nh3_24hr and Grid_snow
DryDep_ml : define Grid%so2nh3ratio24hr, remove Rsur_dry/wet + change call
CoDep_ml.f90: new method for Rns_SO2. Changes also for Rns_NH3. (Was also bug in Rlow here,
it was added both here and in Rsurface_ml)
Rsurface_ml.f90: Re-written so that Rdry and Rwet no longer needed (due to new method for Rns_SO2).
Added new method for snow, for SO2 and O3 (affecting all).

GlobalBCs_ml.f90: added reference to Hicks et al 2002


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_1_9  Dave,   3rd Dec 2008xxxxxx

New system started for Derived components, working for DDEP and
VG outputs. Gets rid of need for hard-coded indices such as DDEP_SOX,
etc., and makes it faster to specify landuse and species options.
(
Changes in:

  My_Derived_ml
  My_DryDep_ml
  My_WetDep_ml   ! Still uses old-scheme, but now has SO2, SO4 etc.
  Derived_ml

Set New meteorology directories (Parlam-PS with snowdepths and ice fraction) in run.pl.
Bug in LandDefs (is_veg) fixed.Mostly affects dry dep velocities of coarse particles over urban areas.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_1_5  Dave,  1st Dec 2008xxxxxx

NetCDF_ml, small change to allow longer variable names, e.g.
DDEP_aNO3_m2Conif:

   !dsDec08 character*18 :: varname
   character(lenxlen(def1%name)) :: varname

and some extra use of MYDEBUG
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_1_4  Peter,  20th Nov 2008xxxxxx

Only minor changes:

Met_ml: "validity" returned from Getmeteofield gets the value "field_not_found" if the field is not found.
This can be used to set foundSSTx.false. for example, or to stop cleanly.

Solver: removed dt_tot, which was not used anyway.(requested by Martin Schultz)

Functions_ml.f90:  in Exner_nd replaced "ix1 x x1" with "ix1 x floor(x1)"
It is somewhat clearer, and works also for negative pressure :-)

run.pl: "#PBS -lpmemx2000MB" , gives higher queue priority on stallo.

My_DryDep: Switched off debug flag

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_1_3  Dave,  8th Nov 2008xxxxxx

Ecosystem dry deps changed, to be per m2 of ecosystem

** Note - this changes the values, since before they were per m2 of Grid,
          not of ecosystem!  No need now to scale anything with landuse
          data.

*Note change of output names:
   DDEP_SOX   is now  DDEP_SOX_m2Grid
   DDEP_OXSCF is now  DDEP_SOX_m2CF
 etc.

My_DryDep - use of AreaCF, AreaDF, etc., plus new names
My_Derived_ml  - Use of new names
Derived_ml     - Use of new names

DryDep_ml  - added arguments to call to Add_ddep
Cellmet_ml - set %coverage, LAI etc to zero before assigning .. safety measure
to allow use of full array from 1..NLANDUSE.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3_1_2  Svetlana,  8th Oct 2008xxxxxx

My_outputs_ml, Sites_ml changed to allow outputs of d_2d variables.

Advection_ml: improved the ADVEC_TYPEx2 option (not the default value) for exact mass conservation
Sites_ml: allow sites/sondes on model boundaries (needed for poles in global runs)
Timing_ml: use MPI_WTIME to measure walltime

None of these changes should affect the results of "standard" runs.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3.0.3, Dave,  Mar 18th 2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GlobalBCs_ml
added 2006 O3 backgroud, using data from Derwent et al. (2007) paper

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3.0.2, Peter,  Mar 3rd 2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Just additional comments in the code.
In ZD_OZONE/MyDerived_ml !NB: do not remove without removing from My_DryDep too

Io_Progs_ml  -  bug fix to remove text trailing # in HEADER line  (doesn't
     matter to results though)

Landuse_ml - small formatting change

NetCDF_ml and Nest_ml reset to rv3beta13 status

1st OPEN SOURCE CODE ON WEB!!!

End of rv3 series. Almost identical to rv3 as given on web, but

(Had to reset Nest_ml and NetCDF_ml to slightly older code. Will
update again as 3.1.

** modrun.pl is still different in rv3 and on web-version. Too many
differences to bother about here.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3beta13  feb 6  2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Small bug: current_date declared twice in NetCDF_ml (does not influence
output, but pgi compiler complains).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3beta12  feb 2  2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter
New update of adv_var: the previous version seemed to hang on stallo in some situations (global model)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3beta11  Jan 31  2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

copied the new Inputs_LandDefs.csv into DataDir and corrected a bug
introduced in run.pl from rv3beta9 when runnning on snykov.

run.pl, modrun.pl - modified to use renamed Inputs_LandDefs.csv


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3beta10  Jan 31  2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dave

DO3SE system simplified to remove various special features. Effect of
old needles removed, and replaced by simply setting lower fphen in
Inputs_DO3SE.csv.

Treatment of Astart, Aend now automatic also - special code removed

Inputs.LandDefs now renamed Inputs_LandDefs.csv, and values changed

Inputs_DO3SE.csv values changed
   - both to reflect revisions to mapping manual, and  recent work

Wesely_ml - tidied up some comments about NH3


SHOULD USE NEW INPUT FILES ALSO!

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3beta9  Jan 16-17  2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Stallo version of run.pl and Makefile_stallo.
Just set STALLOx1. Choose USER, ProgDir,WorkDir, Emissions etc. as usual.
32 procs choosen in ModelConstants_ml.

Put an  MPI_BARRIER in Io_Progs_ml: OpenMPI becomes crazy (huge memory
leak->node crashes) because each line was is in separate buffers to all nodes,
 before they were received.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx rv3beta8  Jan 8-9..11  2008  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Peter, Svetlana

End of run dates for "fullrun" in NetCDF_ml.
Removed "initnetcdf" routine from Unimod and NetCDF_ml (was never used).

Defined veg_month in DryDep. Seemed not to be defined before? Does it work now??
Initialized veg_monthx1 in DO3SE_ml

Changed definition of LandType in LandDefs_ml:
            LandType(n)%is_water  x  LandInput%code xx "W"
            LandType(n)%is_ice    x  LandInput%code xx "ICE"
            LandType(n)%is_iam    x  LandInput%code(1:4) xx "IAM_"

            LandType(n)%is_forest x  &
                ( LandInput%type xx "ECF" .or. LandInput%type xx "EDF" )
            LandType(n)%is_conif x ( LandInput%type xx "ECF"  )
            LandType(n)%is_decid x ( LandInput%type xx "EDF"  )
            LandType(n)%is_crop  x ( LandInput%type xx "ECR"  )
            LandType(n)%is_seminat  x ( LandInput%type xx "SNL"  )
            LandType(n)%is_bulk   x  LandInput%type xx "BLK"
            LandType(n)%is_veg    x  LandInput%type /x "U" .and. &
                  LandInput%hveg_max > 0.01   ! Excludes water, ice, desert

NB:Water defined with type "BLK" in  /home/mifapw/emep_common/Data/Inputs.LandDefs
BUT NOT IN ~mifads/Unify/Data/EMEP/Inputs.LandDefs
Copied also the other input files from ~mifads/Unify/Data/EMEP/ over to /home/mifapw/emep_common/Data and
/home/mifapw/emep_common/Data/EMEP
Changed run.pl to take into account these changes

Uncommented a system call in Nest_ml: can cause problems in combination with OpenMPI (problems appeared on Stallo).

Met_ml: non-blocking MPI_ISEND for wind speeds in metvar.
        Uses dedicated arrays for receive buffers.
    Was giving worng results with -O3 option (!?)

SubMet_ml: Sub(iL)%rh x min(1.0,Sub(iL)%rh)! keeps rh <x 1
       instead of e x min(esat,e)
           Is mathematically identical, but gave slightly different results with -O3 option.

Dave
CellMet_ml: wetarea change to avoid numerical problems.
  !   .... we allow a small build-up phase, with
  !   linear increase from wetareax0 to wetarea x cc3dmax for values of

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, Michael,  rv2_9_7, Sept.  20th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Io_Progs - extra options added to check that required key-value pairs exist.

run.pl   -  Michael's user corrected, and location of sites/sondes redefined.

Sites_ml.f90   --- now expects sites.dat and sondes.dat to have formatted headers.
                   + cleanup

SmallUtils - small update (trim used)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, rv2_9_6, Sept.  19th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Setup_1d_ml: checkstop when a NaN is detected
             removed: use MyChem_ml,  only :  Set_2dBgnd

Met_ml: CheckStop(nhour/x0 .and. nhour /x3..) for netcdf metinput

EmisGet : removed stop when country "N/A" is detected

run.pl: changed the crash message
        included $METformat to switch to necdf for netcdf metdata
    changed -lnodesx16 to be compatible with ModelConstants

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, rv2_9_5, Sept.  15th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

CheckStop added into find_index - to catch cases where the index isn't
   found (was used to track down D2_indices which were not set in
   My_Derived).

My_Derived changed to force use of the hard-coded D2_ values (e.g. D2_AFSTDF16).
  (Should modify rest of code to be more flexible).

Landuse_ml -- commented out lc_water, lc_ice to remove problems.  Will be
  fixed in forthcoming version.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, rv2_9_4, August 30th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Biogenics_ml re-written to simply read in BVOC emission potentials, rather than
   calculate them. Now same procedure for EMEP domain, GLOBAL and HEMIS.

  Associated changes and small tidy-ups in Emissions_ml,  Setup_1d_ml,
     Setup_1dfields_ml, Unimod.f90

Derived_ml --- debugging now uses debug_proc etc. from GridValues. Small bug-fix
    which caused WARNINGS for PR/DEP.

Io_Progs_ml, optional argument CheckValues added to ReadSDN, to let user specify
   key-value pairs that must be included in input file.

Landuse_ml   - slight rename of Inputs.Landuse
My_Emis_ml   - removed MY_MODEL
Met_ml       - small tidy-up
TimeDate_ml  - small tidy-up

run.pl --  $NDATA points to new Inputs directory.
           prog.exe now added into Remove.sh

Inputs: new inputs directory, ~mifads/Data/EMEP (GLOBAL + HEMIS) created while
  new style data being created (with headers and key-values)

cvs DELETED::  UiO_ml  Wrtchem_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, rv2_9_3, August 28th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Unimod.f90: Removed call to DefGrid (moved into Met_ml)
        Read input parameters using read_line

Met_ml.f90: call to infield(1) and DefGrid in the MeteoGridRead routine,
            for the case where felt files are used.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,  rv2_9_2, July 26th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

More variable name changes, for i_glob, j_glob. Full list of recent
changes is:

    ISMBEG x> "IRUNBEG"
   ,JSMBEG x> "JRUNBEG"
   ,IILARDOM x> "IILARGEDOM"
   ,JJLARDOM x> "JJLARGEDOM"
    IILARGEDOM  x> "IIFULLDOM",
   ,JJLARGEDOM  x> "JJFULLDOM"
   ,i_glob  x> "i_fdom"
   ,j_glob  x> "j_fdom"

 The idea is to prevent confusion between global as in for the
World and the computer-concept of global for the full domain.
In future I think global should refer to the World-scale.


DOCS/Manual.tex - changed with suggestion of Part A, Part B
     Outputs.tex - new description of derived outputs
     Input.tex -  small change for input files (DO3SEinputs.csv
            will be introduced soon in place of old MM_biomass, gfac etc.)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,  rv2_9_1, July 20th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Major change - rewrite of Derived and My_Derived

      - should now be much easier to add or remove params from list to be
        included -- just give names (e.g. "DDEP_OXN"). No need to count :-)
        Also, now there is just 2d and 3d  stuff, no more ddep_ and wdep_.
        No need of DUMMY either in 3d output.
        Arrays are allocated as needed.


SmallUtils - added AddArray and LenArray to add arrays, and to count number of
    allocated elements (not allocated define with NOT_SET_STRING

Included Svetlana's OutputChem_ml, a wrapper containing Wrtchem.f90 and other
   subroutines

Deleted: Wrtchem.f90 - now in OutputChem_ml

run.pl - check now added that the number of processors in run.pl matches
   the number in ModelConstants_ml.f90

TO-BE-DONE

 Changes need to be transferred to ACID version

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,  rv2_9, July 19th 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Major change:

 Par_ml.pat   -- deleted! -- now set RUNDOMAIN, and NPROC stuff in ModelConstants
 Par_ml.f90   --  now a normal file, not changed between runs

 ModelConstants - now has:

    RUNDOMAIN x (/  36, 167, 12, 122 /)     ! EMEP domain
    NPROCX      x   4       & ! Actual number of processors in longitude
  , NPROCY      x   4       & ! Actual number of processors in latitude
  , NPROC       x NPROCX * NPROCY

    DomainName x "EMEP-50kmEurope"

  i.e. run.pl does *not* set the model domains any longer, only the year, NTERM, etc.
  Note also --   need to set lnodes correcly in run.pl - but now check values from
  ModelConstants_ml. In future may be able to make this automatic, but not so far.


  Some renaming:

      Instead of using the terms global domain and small domain, I am trying to
      move to full domain (170x133 or global if it really is a global model!)
      and "run" domain.

        ISMBEG ->    IRUNBEG
        JSMBEG ->    IRUNBEG
        IILARDOM  -> IIFULLDOM
        JJLARDOM  -> JJFULLDOM


   Some re-arrangements:

    All "use" statements moved to top of some modules
    Started putting "use" statements  in alphabetical order - much
     easier to find now. Except --  Start lists with My_ modules.
    Thus,

       use My_Chem_ml

       use CheckStop_ml
       use ModelConstants_ml


 Emissions_ml   - very small tidfy up

 Io_Progs_ml      Read2D added

 + probably some other small tidy-ups.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  rv2_8_1,  July 2nd  2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Provisional - needs to be tested still!!!!!!!


Met_ml:  Cleaned(Jan Eiof), also  some extra Met params made available
           (RH2m, Soil water --- but both seem to have problems!)

DOCS/cookbook + other :  Cookbook  1st darft added, Semeena. Now have
     both a cookbook for new users, and a Manual for programmers.
     Do either of:

         latex cookbook
         latex Manual

GridValues_ml: dependence on Io_ml removed (ds)

Io_Progs_ml:   read2DN added (ds) - "fast"  read of New-style input data for
       a file with x, y, z1..z2 type data.


Landuse_ml:  Uses read2DN (ds). Saved 50 lines :-)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  rv2_8,  July 2nd  2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

As used in year 2007 EMEP report work, for SR etc,.

As rv2_7_10, but:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Misc, rv2_7_6,  May 11 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Dave: Added new module CheckStop,  to simplify error-testing and
       calls to MPI_ABORT. Can now do e.g.

              call CheckStop( lu<0,"UKdep lu problem"), or,
              call Check(errmsg,"Something fishy here...") , or, ...

        - there are five possibilities.

       Functions_ml - small cleanup

       ReadField_ml, implicit none added! BUG fixed, CheckStop added,
         + new subroutine to read 3D fields

       Unimod.f90 - check digits(1.0) - that compilation uses double precision

Peter: CheckStop in NetCDF_ml

Svetlana: CheckStop in Emissions_ml
                       Met_ml
                       Volcanoes_ml

Semeena: Cleaned:      MassBudget_ml


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Misc, rv2_7_5, Apr 19 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

April 10th, Dave:

  removed Dates_ml from Makefiles.

  modified ReadField_ml, to allow more than one input line per i,j coord
                         + fewer write statements

April 18th, Peter/Semeena:

    Updated NetCDF_ml such that:
    1) Output is CF-1.0 compilant for the vertical coordinates
    2) Corrected a bug when 3D hourly output is required

    Derived_mland My_Derived: renamed D2_PS as PS, to be more compatible
    with what other use (PS is used in the definition of the vertical levels)

    run.pl: put lpmemx200MB


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Misc, rv2_7_4, Mar 30 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Semeena:  AirEmis_ml cleaned and documented



xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Misc, rv2_7_2 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Peter: Advection_ml: more robust advection for global model.
       UK_ml: bug in effectivdaynumberxdaynumber (no consequences in practice)

       Met_ml: bug in my gc/MPI changes (rv2_7): gb,gl,gb_glob and gl_glob may be wrong
               on nodes different from mexx0.

       Added comment in Emissions_ml (newmonth):units are ktonnes PER YEAR
       Comment:shouldn't we define emissions as ktonnes per 365 days?
       A leap year has more 1 day more DMS emissions than a 365 days year...

Dave: xRgsO corrected in Rsurface_ml for snow. Will change results slightly.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Misc, rv2_7_1  2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Peter:
   Nest_ml - Modex12, for read 3D at start of run and write at end
         and corrected bug in lat lon nesting.
   Makefile_snow, Makefile_njord - replaced Polinat_ml with Trajectory_ml

Joffen:
 Country_ml - cleaned, March 6 2007. This version includes the
  division of ship emissions into inside/outside the 12 mz, EU/ROW flags,
  Ferries/cargo ships as this is supposed to be the "strategy" for the
  future.

  EmisDef_ml.f90: Cleaned by Joffen, March 6th 2007.
   With the division of the ship emissions in Country_ml,
   lots of new "countries are defined in the same grid. thus the
   number of countries allowed in one grid has to be increased (to 10)
   in EmisDef_ml.f90

  Emissions_ml.f90: Modified for use of timefac_index from Country_ml

  Trajectory_ml - replaces Polinat_ml (mainly name change)
  PhyChem_ml    - now refers to trajectory_out


Dave:
  ModelConstanstants_ml - removed assign_nmax, assign_tdadvec

  Advection_ml - placed assign_nmax, assign_tdadvec here


Misc:
  Unimod.f90 - changed to accomodate above changes in routines/modules
    (+ close(IO_TMP) added. Bug!)



xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter 5/3 rv2_7 2007  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

All gc_ routines removed! They are replaced by the standard MPI routines.
Affect most of the files.
You can find an overview of the MPI routines for example at:
http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/mpi/

My_Outputs_ml: Hourly_ASCII x .false. (seriously slows down the program if /global/work is used)
UK_ml.f90: define "effectivdaynumber" for treating Growing Season in Southern Hemisphere
Runchem_ml and Solver: removed dt,reset_chem and Niter, which were not used and may create confusion.
Added Par_ml.f90. It allows to compile without script.

Only numerical changes (<1.E-6) on results.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, Dave   rv2_6_6  6/2...31..23..25/2/2007 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Functions_ml:
Some minima criteria in Ra removed to prevent problems in extreme stable cases

GlobalBCs_ml - updated to 2005

Nest_ml (and Unimod.f90 ,PhyChem_ml):
Mode 10,11 for warm start option and corrected bug ("idimid") when writing in lat lon

NetCDF_ml:
allocate a real*4 array instead of real*8. Avoids possible underflow errors and saves some memory.


XM_MAX_ADVEC removed from Met_ml and Model_constants (was not used)

Met_ml:
small change in definition of "cyclicgrid"

Rsurface_ml:
Some minima criteria removed to prevent problems in extreme stable cases

Included Tareq in run.pl USERS.

Removed srun.pl, nrun.pl, local2global.f, global2local.f, gc_com.f from cvs

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter   rv2_6_5    19/1/2007 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New common run.pl script for njord and snykov. NB: It also use /global/work on snykov.
Use this one as it will simplify maintenance to have
fewer scripts. Not yet made for SR runs (should also be done with the same script).
Choose  $NJORDx1 or $SNYKOVx1 in the script.


Derived_ml:
Changed units written in outputs for all depositions (ug/m2  was written instead of ugS/m2)

Small changes for the global version: (does not affect other runs)

Advection_ml: 2 old "bugs" corrected.
    preadvx(2): did not work if west neighbour x east neighbour (possible in cyclic grid)
    adv_var: nonblocking sends. Otherwise may hang if extremely large grids are used.

Met_ml:
Defined poles when lat > 88 degrees.
Small changes in the extrapolation of xm outside the grid.

Country_ml:
country 67 -> timezonex-100. For unknown countries

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter   rv2_6_4    13-30/11/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Dates_ml - extended LAST_SDYEAR to 2006, Dave

15th Nov put  if(Ascii3D_WANTED)then around the 3d ascii output in Wrtchem.f90
Derived_ml :PS units in hPA

15th Nov Advection_ml "else where" replaced by  "elsewhere" to stop Njords f90 comlpaining

Makefile_njord
Use /home/ntnu/usrlocal/netcdf/netcdf-3.6.1 instead of mifapw's library
Changed -O4 into -O3 -qarchxpwr5 -qtunexpwr5 , because of compiler error during IPA, when compiling the HEMIS grid.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave   rv2_6_3    3/11/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

On request of Peter, removed *.f files (except gc_fcon_for_1proc.f)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter  rv2_6_2   27/10/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Version compatible with "njord", IBM p575+ 16-way nodes, AIX , Load Leveler

gc_com,local2global,global2local set to f90

MARS_ml.f90 line 864 1.d0 changed to 1.0
TimeDate_ml: line 53 reduced month length to 10
Derived_ml.f90 : case ( "MAXADV" ) changed forall (program crashes with segmentation fault otherwise??)
Advection_ml: changed hel1/hel2 into hel1/(hel2+1.0E-100)
          because of overflow otherwise (compiler weakness, works without if only -O2 is used)
removed all *.f files (gc_com.f,local2global.f,global2local.f)
new nrun.pl and nSRrun.pl (n for njord)

Makefile_njord created
Makefile_snow updated (.f removed or replaced with .f90)

Put values in the "k" og the Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions.nc


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Heiko  rv2_6_1  25/10/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

 I just found a problem in the Makefile_snow, it included

 clean:
     rm ... \
     touch ... \
     make depend


 The last one did thus run 'make depend' instead of 'make -f
 Makefile_snow depend'. This is fixed in the cvs'd file.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter  rv2_6   23/8/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Included Nesting options.
Not enough tested but needed for ENEA delivery: 3D BC 3-hourly all components.
For a nest run: Set MODE and istart,jstart,iend,jend

Nest_ml: completely revised
NetCDF_ml: secondssince1970 public,
           not time at middle of period for instant data (like BC).
PhyChem_ml: moved wrtxn call.

SRx0 should work too  (SRrun.pl)

Changed My_Reactions so that it is fast on snowstorm (and embla).
The old one has been put into My_Reactions.inc_blizz


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Anna, Peter, Hilde rv2_5beta2   30/6/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

SRx0 should work too

SRx1 moved higher up in SRrun.pl (was bug: $iyr_trend was never set to 2010)
$iyr_trend x "2020" if $SR  in SRrun.pl


SRrun.pl changed to include PM_ADDED. mkp.pmemis_from_nox changed (and new name), do not include Azerbaijan anymore - we have those PM emissions.
Country_ml.f90: ATX now seax1

noxsplit.special.2000 should not have been there, the default split should be used for all years before 2010. File removed from datadirectory.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Anna, Peter, Dave rv2_5beta2   28-29/6/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

SR version

My_Derived:
SOURCE_RECEPTOR x .true.
NDERIV_3D x  0

Global_BC:

DEBUG options set to false in rv2_5beta

SRrun.pl created to look after SR runs
ATX defined as part of ATL and RUX as part of RU (in femis)

iyr_trend added to RunLog output


SEASALT set to .false.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, rv2_5beta   27/6/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New flux parameters slightly re-defined. MMAOT30 and MMAOT40 added - AOTs according to
 new Mapping Manual approaches.
 Now:
    D2_AFSTDF0, D2_AFSTDF16, D2_AFSTBF0, D2_AFSTBF16, &
    D2_AFSTCR0, D2_AFSTCR3, D2_AFSTCR6,&
    D2_MMAOT30, D2_MMAOT40

Country_ml - updated from Heiko

Derived_ml - new flux stuff added

DryDep_ml - SumVPD limitations added for IAM_WHEAT

UK_ml - safety checks added on SGS, EGS
        InGrowingSeason array defined to simplify MMAOT calculation


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, rv2_4_8   25/6/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Ooops.... forgot to copy My files form main directory into ZD_OZONE before cvs commit.
Done now....
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, rv2_4_7   22/6/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New flux parameters defined,  see JUN06 changes
    D2_AFSTDF0, D2_AFSTDF16, D2_AFSTBF0, D2_AFSTBF16, &
    D2_AFSTCR0, D2_AFSTWCR, D2_AFSTCR6,&
    D2_AFSTCN0, D2_AFSTCN3, D2_AFSTCN6,&

New landuse setup files - in JUN06_biomass.dat etc.
  - results in different growing seasons and depositions for forests
    (e.g. reduced deposition in summer in Mediterranean)

New landuse map - some small corrections, and 3 IAM categories.

Used 4.5 ppb for iyr_trend >x 2010 - quick fix for JUN06 IAM runs.

$MAKE added in srun.pl, to call Makefile_snow if needed. Check if it
       works for others, and usage of .depend!!!

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter v2_4_6_1, 14/6/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Updated srun.pl: corrected bug (see rv2_4_5). Include "Africa"
Added: Makefile_snow

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Joffen v2_4_6, 30/5/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

noxsplit changes - splits NO and NO2 similar to VOC. Use "2000" files to get default
9:95% split that we had before

... and from Dave : srun.pl added to cvs, for UiT use.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter rv2_4_5, 15/5/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Bug in grun.pl put in version 2_4_3. Wrong meteo link.
Sometimes the first day of a month is linked to the 1/1/ of next year.
The program will notice this and crash.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,Heiko rv2_4_5, 19/4/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Added gc_com.f into the CVS repository. Seems to be missing. It should have been added when Peter removed gc_com.F


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter rv2_4_4, 15/2/2006 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Accept any projection in CF-1.0 convention.

NetCDF accept "general projection"
Met_ml  accept "general projection"
moved some "use Gridvalues :sigma" (the SGI compiler didn't like variables
                        to be send as argument and defines with "use")
GridValues AN calculated in GlobalPosition
Derived_ml daily D3_THx.False.
Dates_ml: included 2004

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter rv2_4_3, 16/12/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Better Global version. In case of lon-lat grid and poles, special advection
routines are used.

grun.pl includes a parameter   $HEMIS which (whenx1) makes the script link to
the hemispherical input data. (this script is however quite messy...)
meteo year must be 2001 then.
(put also READBVOCx.true. in Biogenics_ml for improved BVOC emissions)

Meteorology for a whole year can be found at (met.no):
/fou2/emep2/Meteorology/ERA-40/2001_HEMIS_PS/

or (blizzard):
/home/peterw/emep/work/metdata/ERA_2001_HEMIS/


No changes of results in "normal" runs, except that in Country_ml, Russia (42)
 is defined with timezone -100, which means that longitude time is used.
(can be changed in the file if wanted)


ModelConstants_ml, Unimod.f90,Solver: dt_advec is set according to gridwidth

EmisGet_ml: use country%index to interpret country mumbers in emis
files and femis.dat

Country_ml: 193 countries defined (country index semi-official: defined by Heiko)

Met_ml: bug: should broadcast projection (concern only netcdf met input)

AirEmis_ml: bug when longitude close to 360 degrees or when latitudex90

Emissions_ml: bug in "daytime_longitude"

Advection_ml: new subroutines for advection used in case of lat-lon
grid. Less good treatment of the xy time splitting, but faster and
can cope with singularity at Poles.
Changed also adv_var, so that it can treat the
case when a subdomain is its own neighbor (cyclic grid).
For best efficiency of advection it is recommended to use NDYx2 (or
NDYx1) in case lat-lon and poles are included in the domain.


PhyChem_ml: calls  advecdiff_poles instead of advecdiff when necessary

GridValues_ml,Met_ml,Unimod.f90:: removed jmin_advec, jmax_advec, put Poles into GridValues

GlobalBC_ml,GridValues_ml: redefined lb2ij

Sites_ml: can read files in lon-lat coordinates. The file must be
called sondesLL.dat or sitesLL.dat. Height is always set to KMAX_MID.

Biogenics_ml: Includes an option to read BVOC.dat directly
    (temporary solution)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter rv2_4_2, 22/11/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

EmisGet changed to include VOC sector 10 by default (perviously excluded).
Now only sector 11 is exlcuded.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter rv2_4_1, 22/11/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GLOBAL version of the model

Lat lon grid possible (defined through mapping factors xm_i and xm_j)

Cyclic grid in i direction

Special treatment at poles:
    -.no "neighbors", but not an outer boundary
    -.special treatment of advection

Emission_ml includes an option to choose that the local time
 (used for the day/night timefactor) is determined by the longitude
instead of the timezone defined in "Countries_ml". This option is selected when timezonex-100.
This should be better at least for countries which cover many
timezones (Russia, USA ...)
 (This also avoids defining timezones for hundreds of countries :-)

splitted parinit into two subroutines, one for subdomain sizes and the
other for neighbors and BC definitions

Removed the last optional argument from CloudAtten in Radiation_ml:
it produced a compiler error in PhyChem_ml, even if I didn't change
PhyChem nor Radiation !?

EmisGet keep VOC from sector 10 (it was removed in earlier versions)

Modified: Unimod.f90, Model_Constants, GridValues_ml, Met_ml,
Boundary_Conditions, Par_ml.pat,NetCDF_ml, Advection_ml,
Emissions_ml, My_Output_ml, Radiation_ml, EmisGet_ml

Still the results are not affected by these changes (!)
Yearly results compared to rv2_1 by Joffen.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter rv2_3_3, 26/10/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Major clean up of binary output and all the .F files. As a consequence several parts of
the Makefile got also cleaner.

Removed:
Output_binary_ml,rmycop.c,getflti2.f,getflti2.F,putflti2.f,putflti2.F,outchem_restri.f,
put_restri_i2.f,put_restri_i2.F, gc_com.F

Modified: Met_ml, NetCDF_ml, Wrtchem.f90, Output_hourly.f90 Makefile

Parts of Output_binary are moved into Wrtchem.
Parts of getflti2.f are put into Met_ml in order to still be able to read the met files in binary.

Results are not affected by these changes

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter & Joffen (+Maarten+Dave)  rv2_3_2, 6/10/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New AirEmis from Joffen. More general: can use any grid. Some differences
in results can be expected (due to different vertical interpolation).

Changes in GlobalBC Macehead corrections.
The macehead correction uses now lat lon coordinates instead of "i,j".
This will however make a difference on the results, since the "Macehead sector" is now
defined with lon lat borders. I choosed these rather arbitrarily.
A small test for 2001 shows the following for the "O3fix" correction:
jan: old O3fixx-6.903 ; newO3fixx-6.635
aug: old O3fixx-4.871 ; newO3fixx-4.876

In the future we should also introduce an option (as an input parameter)
to skip the Macehead correction


Changed Par_ml.pat so that also the large domain is set by grun.pl
Changed grun.pl sp that it sets the large domain in Par_ml.
The date of start is now read in by the model.
The program tries now first to find at NetCDF meteo input file, if it does
not find it it reads the old felt files.
NB: You MUST update grun.pl


Changed definition of xm_i and xm_j: now it is directly the mapping factor
at the boundary of two gridcells.

Changed slightly Timefactors: if just "fname" is declared the values of "an" (from GridValues)
is overwritten(!!!). If instead fname2 and fname0  are declared (as done now) there seems to be
no problems(!). Very strange. Most probably a compiler error. The strange behaviour don't appear
when all the debugger options are on.

NetCDF_ml: We go over to CF-1.0 convention.

Output_binary: corrected an old bug
     !character(lenxsize(f_2d(1)%class)) :: typ  !  See defs of f_2d
     character(lenxlen(f_2d(1)%class)) :: typ  !  See defs of f_2d

Modified: NetCDF_ml, AirEmis,Met_ml,Par_ml.pat,GlobalBC,Log.changes,GridValues,
Unimod.f90,Timefactors_ml,grun.pl,Output_binary


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,   rv2_3_1, 5/10/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NetCDF input for BIC.

Changed GlobalBCs_ml.f90 so that it can read the BIC from a netCDF file.
The file should be named "Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions.nc" (for now).
If the file or component is not found it looks for the "old" BIC files (D3_O3.01 etc).

An example of BIC file is given in /noserc2/emep/BIC/BIC.nc
Using this file should give the same results as before.
It contains also O3 data constructed from sattellite data. (This data needs to be more tested/ developed)

In the future the BIC.nc file should be global and the fields are to be interpolated to the required grid.

Some changes in NetCDF_ml and corresponding changes in Output_binary and Output_hourly.

Included xm_i and xm_j: the directional map factors. These are equal for a Polar Stereographic projection. (not yet tested in another grid)
(GridValues_ml and Met_ml)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave/Hilde,   rv2_2_14 , 14/6/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

.depend:      Removed from CVS. Not needed, as gmake depend generates it, and
              it complicates cvs commit.

DryDep_ml:    Tidy up (interim), plus some commented out code marker for
              EXTRA_LU outputs added - often used, but has no effect as coded
              now. Can be used to call user-generated include files if
              uncommented.

GlobalBCs_ml: Small correction to Mace head correction

GridValues_ml:  New DEBUG system introduced. GridValues now works out immediately
        which processor the DEBUG_i, DEBUG_j coordinates apply to (new logical
        debug_proc set true), and then calculates the local coordinates
       (debug_li, debug_lj). Other modules may now printout debug info with
       a system such as :


           if ( debug_proc )  then
              write(*,*) "Debuuging ", some_data(debug_li,debug_lj,KMAX_MID)
           end if

         ... instead of having to test i_glob, j_glob against DEBUG_i, DEBUG_j
          as before.  ( See the new PhyChem_ml for other examples)

         Request: please switch modules you work on to this new system - it is
         cleaner and faster.


PhyChem_ml.f90 - replaces phyche.f. Finally f90 !!!!!!!! ;-)

           Code tidied up. Makes use of DEBUG_i, DEBUG_j

phyche.f   ..... history !


Setup_1d_fields_ml - removed unused Idrctt, Idffuse

Unimod.f90         - uses PhyChem_ml, tidied up "use statements"

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,  rv2_2_8  , 11/4/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Rn222 and Pb210 added (for CARBOSOL, but a useful general tracer)
Quite crude addition. Should probably be harmonised with
other surface emissions  such as BVOC or Sea-Salt. ToDo.

My_Chem_ml            - Pb210 added
DepVariables_ml       - LU_ICE added
Setup_1d_ml.f90       - rc_Pb210 added

UK_ml   -   water_fraction  and ice_fraction added


Some general tidy-ups

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde,  rv2_2_7 , 08/4/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Small errors in ZD_ACIDs My_BoundCondition and My_Outputs corrected

New (simpler?) arrangements for calculations of ustar, Obukhov length, Exner
Less confusing use and conversions between temperature (t2_nwp) and
potential temperature (TPot2m).


Some new notations:

       tau     - was fm
       t2_nwp  - was t2
       TPot2m  - was th2m
       ustar_nwp - was ustar
       invL_nwp  - was invL

   The _nwp is used where variables are appropriate to the whole grid. When
   sub-grid procedurs are applied then different values of e.g. ustar may
   be different for different landuses.

Functions_ml
     - Exner function subroutines, and conversion functions between T and Tpot
         - causes changes in Met_ml, Sites_ml, DryDep, .....
       Note that sometimes we need Exner_nd(p) and sometimes CP*Exner_nd(p)

Met_ml
     - tau (was fm) - now created for MM5-type inputs from ustar, on assumption
       that it is better to linearly interpolate tau in metint than ustar.
       (Since tau ~ ustar**2 is proportional to energy.)

     - Surface temp is now t2_nwp. Multiple conversions to old th2m now
       removed. Tpot2m (was th2m)  now done in met_deriv

     - Exner_ml used

SeaSalt
     - use of new ustar_nwp. Moved "use" statements to start of module (should
       be done for all modules)

Tabulations_ml
       Exner stuff removed. Only tab_esat remains!

Also - ZD_ACID/My_Chem changes for new Radiation_ml treatment: zen, radzen
       ZD_ACID/My_Outputs corrected for N_NOy.

DOCS:
    - Corrected figure of Arakaw u,v grid locations, based upon plot from Peter
    - Added new rule in Progrules.tex, suggested by Peter


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,  rv2_2_5 , 5/4/2005 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Re-write of Radiation_ml and associated handling

**** NEW *****
TimeDate_ml.f90 - added. Much nicer date calculations! (Will supercede Dates_ml
                    in future code)
**** NEW *****

Radiation_ml - subdivided with new routines and re-arranged. Now doesn't need Par_ml.
               Uses elemntal routines to allow use in both 1-d models and EMEP

               Some changes
                 SolarSetup  subroutine
                 Ashrea table ......
                 ZenithAngle sub
                 etc.-

Causes small changes in many routines which used radiation, zen, etc., inc:

   Met_ml - now used to store Idirect, Idiffuse
   PhysicalConstants_ml - DAY_ZEN, DAY_COSZEN added
   phyche.f -  subroutine calls changed

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde, rv2_2_4  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GlobalBCs_ml - BC for so2,nox,nh4 allowed for year>2003. Trend BCs also for NO,NO2,PAN
My_BoundConditions, ACID - no3, nh4 bcs added

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,  rv2_2_3 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

DryDep_ml    - "call ReadLanduse" moved to Unimod.f90
Emissions_ml - some dead code removed
UK_ml        - ukdep_init called on all nodes. Removed  need for man gc_rbcast lines
Unimod.f90   - "call readLandUse" moved here.
Wrtchem      - AOT output removed.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, rv2_2_2 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Redefined u_ref into Met_ml including the map factor:
NB: Will influence the depositions rates,
specially in Southern areas (15% higher deposition rate in Greece?).
Concentrations and depositions may change by several % in Southern areas.


I propose the following principle for variables derived from
meteo variables in Met_ml:

one routine (metvar) controls the variables derived from the meteofields
after every meteoread (every METSTEP)

one routine (metint) redefines (interpolates) the meteo fields between
each meteoread (every dt_advec)

one routine (met_derived (new)) derives the meteofields after each
interpolation (i.e. met_derived is called from or after metint)

In this logic tiphys is called from metvar  and u_ref is defined
in met_derived

metvar needs some cleaning. Volunteers?


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, rv2_2_1 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Defined "ref_latitude" which is latitude for true distances (60 for PARLAM-PS)

GlobalBCs_ml: defined IGLOB x IILARDOM and JGLOB x JJLARDOM (resulting values
are the same as before, but in new grids these will change)

Removed part in ReadField for non-EMEP grid.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, rv2_2_0 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Included a new routine into Met_ml which is able to read meteo fields
in NetCDF format. Still under development.
The old one is still used as default.

Some cleaning. Removed some meteo fields which are not often used,
but kept SST for Svetlana)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, rv2_1_10  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

UniMan added!
        - intended as guide for new users, and reminder for old ones.


Met_ml - some tidy up ot tkediff subroutine, to follow coding suggestions
         of User guide.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Joffen (Peter) 7/3-2005       , rv2_1_9 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Additional meteo prameters are read: cloud convection and sea surface temp (ccc and sst)

Gutas parameterization of the boundary layer turbulaence and the old parameterization are both included. To choose between them the logical parameter  TKE_DIFF has to be set.

In addition some cleaning up of outdated programming has been done, as
do xxx i x 1, iend


xxx continue

where xxx is a number

has been replaced by
do i x 1,iend

end do


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter 21/2-2005            , rv2_1_8 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Moved the parameter NTDAY from Derived_ml into ModelConstant_ml.
Added some comments.
Changed a comment in Advection_ml.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde/Dave 18/2-2005            , rv2_1_7 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Submitted Hilde's changes to BCs for historical runs.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave  17/2-2005            , rv2_1_6 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


ReadField_ml
  -Initialisation to zero added, so now we do not need to input an array which
   covers the whole domain.

   Also, print used instead of write for error messages, and
   errmsg more explicit now.

Sites_ml: Fix for Embla/Gridur bug,  where printouts of numbers < 1.0e-99
            were messed up.

          Also, N_NIT renamed to N_NOy, and sum_NIT renamed to sum_NOy, since
          NIT is confusing with nitrate, which NOy isn't.

ZD_.../My_Outputs:   N_NIT -> N_NOy

         Also, max NSITES_MAX and NSONDES_MAX increased to 99.
         (Temporary. Will make arrays allocatable soon....)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, 9/2-2005            , rv2_1_5 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

N_NIT was not defined in ZD_ACID
Updated ZD_ACID/My_Ouputs_ml so that it is compatible with the ZD_OZONE
changes.I defined N_NITx1. If necessary please define differently.
(Also changed to NHOURLY_OUT x 1, since clouds do not seem to be defined.)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde, 3/1-2005            , rv2_1_4  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

grun.pl updated also

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde, 3/1-2005            , rv2_1_3  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Sites_ml.f90: increased nmax_sonde
3D fields for pressures etc, from joffen: Derived_ml.f90, My_Derived
Changes for trend output:My_Outputs_ml.f90
Name on 3D ouput changed: Wrtchem.f90

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde, 15/12-2004            , rv2_1_2  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

BC trends 1980-2003 for S and N based on EPA emissions for 1980-2003 added in
GlobalBCs_ml. For NH4 the trend is based on 2/3SO2 +1/3NOx

Also, PhiH added to Functions_ml, Dave

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    rv2.1 x rv2_0_8   same as used for SR matrix work for IIASA, Oct 2004
            but rv2_0_9 has no numerical change, so we rtag the code here.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, 29/10-2004            , rv2_0_9  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

added file gc_com_for_1_proc.f
This can be used as a "fake" gc_com.f in the cases where
NPROCx1 and no mpi compiler is available.
To use it: replace gc_com.f with gc_com_for_1_proc.f and remove the
preprocessing of gc_com.F from Makefile


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter, 5/10-2004            , rv2_0_9  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

in grun.pl:  $BCDIRO3    x "$HILDE/BC_data/LOGAN_O3_DATA/50Data_900mbar_mixratio_firstline"

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, 29/9-2004            , rv2_0_8  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

skipx1 on open_file in Global_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave, 29/9-2004            , rv2_0_8  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

maceheadxmacehead+3 ppb  for 2010 runs


xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Svetlana, Peter  28/09-2004, rv2_0_7  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SeaSalt_ml.f90 used "rough.170" to find sea areas (iclas x 0)
Now it has been changed to identify sea areas using "landuse.mars2004" data
and scales the sea salt emissions with the water area fraction in the grid.

New grun.pl with extra RunLog info.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,Dave;Hilde  24-28/09-2004, rv2_0_6  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

grun.pl: Redefined BC from Logan for O3 for OZONE
Defined SOMO0 in Derived_ml
DryDep - modified for safer flux calculations
UK_ml - luflux_wanted set true for decid forests and wheat only.
Makefile without debug options

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,Svetlana,Dave  24/09-2004, rv2_0_5  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ZD_ACID/,ZD_OZONE/My_Aerosols_ml:
     t20(:)  x 293.  (instead of  t20(:)  x 283.)

molwt defined as real in My_Chem_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,  23/09-2004, rv2_0_4  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Modified Setup_1d and Met_ml: subtracted 1.E-9 from u,v, it2m and itemp.
This should not change results, but is there in order to avoid
rounding differences on gridur and cluster.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,  17/09-2004, rv2_0_4  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Derived_ml and ZD_OZONE/My_Derived_ml:
five new d_2d ("D2_SOMO35","D2_AOT30f",D2_AOT40f","D2_AOT60f","D2_AOT40c").

NB: the definition of SOMO35 is slightly different than in "hourlyozone2ramot35":
1)the running average is done over 20 minutes intervalles
2)period 16-24 also taken into account (was not in in the first version of ramot35)
Note that the end of SOMO35 day is at midnight (not end_of_emepdayx06:00)

Derived_ml
Introduced new "averaging" for yearly and monthly output of AOTXXc, AOTXXf, SOMO35, D2_MAXO3, D2_MAXOH, D2_EUXXX og D2_UNXXX.

NB: the D2_MAXO3 obtained in the yearly output is slightly different than that obtained using "hourlyozone2ramot35" on hourly output, because in the yearly the max is taken on EMEP_day, while "hourlyozone2ramot35" uses 00:00-24:00.

Dry_Dep_ml: bug corrected (small effect (<1%) on results) in def of SAIadd

My_BoundaryConditions_ml: removed a double declaration of IXADV_H2O2 (compiler on blizzard don't like that)

small changes in grun.pl

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde,  27/08/2004, rv2_0_3  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GlobalBCs_ml
 My_Chem_ml and My_BoundConditions_ml in OZONE

 H2O2 and CH3COO2 BC corrected for H2O2 and CH3COO2.
 OH BCs in OZONE taken out.

 Hilde 27/8/2004

Output_hourly  -- cfac comments fixed to 50m->3m

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,              6-11/07/2004, rv2_0_2  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GlobalBCs_ml: 2002 and 2003 added to mace_head. Preliminary values needed for
   EMEP report, derived from Mace Head obs data for CFCs

My_Derived_ml: Warnings only written once now in My_Derived, to avoid huge log
    files (only done in ACID so far)

My_Outputs: Cloud added as example.  (only done in ACID so far)

Output_hourly: "Cloud" added as option for Output_hourly

grun.pl: no bzip2 of hourly.nc file. Some emisdir changes. Alsop BCDIR moved so that
    OZONE always uses 1997 stuff. (BCDIR is only really needed for ACID, since it
    is intended that BCDIR contains the output of OZONE mode runs).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde,               01/06/2004, rv2_0_1  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ACID and OZONE changes to include BCs from OZONE (OH,CH3COO2,H2O2, O3(acid)). For OZONE, this will have
 effect only when a smaller domain than 170*133 is used.
Link to Logan files in mixing ratio.
Some SR-My_Derived stuff that should not have been put into ACID removed.
Files changed:
grun.pl
GlobalBCs_ml
My_BoundConditions_ml
My_Derived_ml, only for ACID
My_DryDep_ml
Setup_1d_ml
My_Chem_ml

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter/Dave               01/04/2004, rv2_0beta  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New grun.pl which also runs SR if required.

new vocsplit data, obtained from a mxiture of IIASA emissions and IER speciation,
for  year 2000 and year 2010.

bunzip2 bug fixed

Biogenics_ml.f90 forests.tf2 renamed to forests.dat


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter/Dave               01/04/2004, rv1_9_34   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

grun.pl added  ja and ja -s to give resource use info in the output

New forest and landuse input data


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hilde,               01/04/2004, rv1_9_33   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Pseudo H2O2 concentrations introduced in ACID to account for ox. limitations.
Solver and My_Reactions.inc (ZD_ACID) changed.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,               31/03/2004/ 01/04/2004, rv1_9_33   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
small changes in grun.pl:
    sites.* are tared: tar cvf ${runlabel1}.sites sites.*
    RunLog is renamed ${runlabel1}_RunLog
    bzip2 is made parallell: to compress files just add them into  @bigfile_list
ZD_OZONE/My_Output: only O3 as hourly output

some removal of double declarations
removed version attribute from Netcdf files. (use runlabel instead)

SeaSalt_ml: replaced vind10 ** (3.41) by exp(log(vind10) * (3.41))


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,               31/03/2004, rv1_9_32   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

 My_Derived_ml:

  !ds 24/3/2004:
  !dsNSR - new system for distinguishing source-receptor (SR) stuff from model
  !        evaluation.  The SR runs should use as few as possible outputs
  !        to keep CPU and disc-requirements down. We define first then the
  !        minimum list of outputs for use in SR ("NSR_2D"), then define an extra list
  !        of parameters (dimesnion NEXTRA_"2D) needed in model evaluation, or even
  !        for the base-case  of SR runs.

  Also define SOURCE_RECPEPTOR in My_Derived. Used in Derived to set all daily
  outputs to false if .true.

  Also defined two new params: NOXxNO+NO2, NOZxlots of NOxzy thingies

 Derived_ml:

  Consistency_check in Derived now checks that if SOURCE_RECPETORx.true. then
  dimension of NDERIV_2D xx NSR_2D

  FST30 added to def_2d. Other FSTs renumbered

  Also defined two new params: NOXxNO+NO2, NOZxlots of NOxzy thingies

 DepVariables_ml

     ECO_SEMINAT redefined to include more categories

  My_DryDep_ml

     Depositions to water and wetlands removed.


private added to:
Dates_ml.f90
ModelConstants_ml.f90


And, for information, the file Sorted.Deriv is now in my Unify directory - it
gives the numbers used in the Derived fields. Makes it easy to find some
free numbers for new variables.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Svetlana/Peter,     24/03/2004, rv1_9_31   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

SeaSalt included into PM10, PM25, PMco

Added some "fake" declarations into ZD_ACID

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Svetlana/Peter,     23/03/2004, rv1_9_29   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Inclusion of Sea salt

Dates_ml: LAST_SDYEAR x 2003


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,     17/03/2004, rv1_9_28   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    Deriv for new 3D fields added
        d_3d for new 3D fields added, inc use of End_of_Day
        gc_abort  added if 3d type not found

DryDep_ml
        Fixed bug in SAIadd found by Peter
        changed g_pot to 1.0 for wheat
Runchem
        Test output of OH, H2O2, (TMP)
UK_ml
        debug_i x> DEBUG_i
Wrtchem
        Allows ascii 3D output, for BCs

ZD_OZONE/My_Chem_ml
        NSPEC_SHL has 1 added for Hilde's IXSHL_PHNO3, PHNO3
        Affects all NSPEC_TOT numbers

ZD_OZONE/My_Reactions:_ml
        PHNO3 added.
        Slightly CPU-faster lines for VOLFAC stuff.

ZD_OZONE/My_Derived
        with extra 3D. Also renamed D2_H2O to D2_PM25_H2O

ZD_OZONE/My_Outputs
        Ascii_3D_WANTED added - generates 3D BCs if set
        some extra ouputs (TMP!)


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,     5/03/2004, rv1_9_27   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Version compatible with Intel and Lahey compiler on IBM cluster (blizzard)

NB: change in grun.pl: will not work with old grun.pl

Several modules: Removed double declarations,
             Removed lines containing only a continuation line (&) (compiler bug)

Advection_ml: preadvx,preadvy:
         small bug in array size declaration (preadvx only)
             non-blocking send with buffered arrays
BoundaryConditions_ml:
        allocate also when sizex0
            forall with mask replaced by loop

Dates_ml: small bug in add_2dates (newdate%month could be > 12 at some intermediate stage)

EmisGet: test of intext with "any" crashed: replaced by a loop

Emissions_ml: initialisations

MARS_ml: molnu,phimult defined as intent(in)

Radiation_ml: initialize coszenx0. ( (?)so that it can be used in
        "real, dimension(size(coszen,1),size(coszen,2)) :: expa, catten, Idrctn")

Sites_ml: added fmtx" " in write(xxx,fmtx" " )

Unimod.f90: read input parameters from file (INPUT.PARA) instead of from standard input
        The file INPUT.PARA is produced by grun.pl

grun.pl: produce INPUT.PARA to be read by Unimod.f90

Makefile: commented out debug option

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Svetlana,     4/03/2004, rv1_9_26 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
PM Water added to aerosols for OZONE.  Needs extension to ACID but to be done.....
commited by Dave, so changes need to be filled in later.  From Sevtlana:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hi, Dave and Peter

I put PM_water (parameter 662) to ACID/OZONE_rv.1.9.25
I've made one-day runs with ACID and OZONE. The values for water
looked reasonable

Everuthing  is on ~mifast/Unified__rv.1.9.25/Unimod.

New lines are marked with  "!water".

The modules affected are:
  phyche.f
  Runchem_ml      (calls Aero_water when daily output)
  Derived_ml
  Chem_ml

and  My_Aerosols_ml      (got new subroutine Aero_water)
         My_Derived_ml

I've also attached for Peter my earlier e-mail ( see below).
I reckon you, guys, can decide between yourself on how to procede.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


AFRIC_ADDED bit (non-serious bug) fixed in grun.pl



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,        20/02/2004, rv1_9_25 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GlobalBCs_ml     ... bug fixed: SpecBC needs to be set for all used species
                    (H2O2 wasn't) check for this added

PhysicalConstants_ml ...   RAD2DEG added

Radiation_ml.f90 --- Bug found! 1900 wrongly added to year. Gives small
                      shift in equation of time (e.g. 8 mins for Jul 1st), hence
                      declention angle and zenith angle.

                 --- solarnoon and daylength calculation added. Useful in ACID

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Peter,        17/02/2004, rv1_9_24 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NetCDF_ml: Out_netCDF, optional input parameter "fileName_given", can be
    used to explicitely give the name of an output file.
    The use of fileName_given is probably slower than the implicit
    filename used by defining iotyp. Use it only if a "non-standard"
    output (i.e. not out_year.nc etc.) is needed

Met_ml: defined case(-11) to define sdot when it is given at level
    boundaries instead of midlevels. (ident(6)x-11 is pw defined)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,        29/01/2004, rv1_9_23 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

RunChem_ml ... debug_flag set false before DEBUG tests
grun.pl  - now chooses sonde file depending on SR or not - fewer stations
           used for SR runs.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,        21/01/2004, rv1_9_22 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GlobalBCs_ml   - add close(IO_GLOBBC)  statements after read. Maybe it doesn't
                 matter, but it feels safer!

grun.pl - add OHDIR for acid if $SR
        - remove any .nc files prsent in WORKDIR
        - add new small domain for extended OSPAR
        - compresses day.nc and hour.nc files with bzip2
        - Hilde on u6, not u5 now.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,        17/01/2004, rv1_9_21 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New Derived system added for ACID also. See comments on OZONE introduction
below.

Bug-fix: ddep needed initialisations for ecosystem stuff!


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,        13/01/2004, rv1_9_20 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Derived_ml -- added T for month in D2_MAXO3


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,         7/01/2004, rv1_9_19 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Changes to fix initialisation bug for AOT found by Peter:

Derived_ml
My_DryDep_ml

grun.pl domain extended beyond OSPAR to East, but only to jx7 in
south, because of BC problems (especially with rainfall from
jx1..7).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,        26/12/2003, rv1_9_18 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

DryDep_ml   - leaf_flux initialised to zero for each landuse
NetCDF_ml   - write used instead of print. (Reason: write output is buffered
              whereas print is not. Hence, for normal use, write is better.
              For trapping errors (e.g. before gc_abortx, print is better.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dave,     21-22/12/2003, rv1_9_17 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

New Derived system!! Changes in many routines. Main idea is to
set variables by name in My_Derived_ml, and let Derived_ml work
out what these are. "Master" lists of derived variables are kept
in def_xx variables which correspond to the used f_xx (i.e.
def_ddep contains the full list of possible f_ddep).

In other routines, most changes are to "use Derived" instead of
"use My_Derived".

BUG-FIX - c_hveg O3 calculation improved in DryDep_ml

BUG-FIX -  grun.pl improved for usage of mkp.pmadd

NetCDF_ml: write NetCDF output files
       new definition of projection_params
       Instantaneous concentration file

Many changes in Nest_ml

Met_ml: Test ident(17) for defining xp,yp
        (not used yet but available: calculate sigmadot from a mass
                                     conserving principle)

New ammoium and nitrate indexes, eq models rewritten/added.

Indexes have been changed so that AMSU and AMNI do not exist anymore. Intead we have aNO3 (aerosol nitrae) and aNH4(aerosol ammonium). The Ammonium routine is rewritten to handle the new indexes. MARS and EQSAM can be run instead of Ammoniun by setting true/false in My_Aerosols_ml.
EQSAM is set as 'default'.

Version used for Helcom runs.
Added ij Hilde's stack table, but used NEMISLAYERS in EmisDef instead of
KEMISTOP in ModelConstants, to keep emission definitions in Emis files.
Added crude effect of wetness on RextS in Rsurface_ml.

0) Started this Log.changes file. Please add your changes here as appropriate.
  Of course, now the code is under CVS control, differences between releases
  can be easily obtained, but a simple Log file is also helpful.

1) Merged Peter's, Hilde's and my changes in emep1.2beta2, plus

  EmisDef_ml- ANTROP_SECTORS added
  EmisGet_ml- ANTROP_SECTORS added

2) Fixed bugs listed on forum
  Derived_ml - fixed timefrac

3) Re-coded DryDep model to work for ACID

4) ACID version update and tested

5) Merged inpar, in_isnowc and (commented out SetZ0) into MetModel_LandUSe
   in Met_ml. The idea is to keep all HIRLAM/mm5 met data in the same place

6) Moved V_RAIn to ModelCOnstants. Put DEBUG_i, DEBUG_j into ModelConstants -
   used to specifiy which grid square print-outs are wanted for.

7) Setup_1d_ml.f90 - max(1,izen) added
                - In trotrep version xn_shl was reset
  to xn_2d. In emep1.2beta this wasn't done. The 2beta
  version is therefore faster, but this reset allows
  stats such as max_oh to be calculated. Therefore trotrep
  version adopted.

8) Ecosystem-specific deposition added for OXN over seas and forests, for
   Jurek's HELCOM request.

9) INTERACTIVE option added to grun.pl - useful when preparing code for
    running with totalview.

1)Added a test in ReadField_ml, to see if we use the
 EMEP map. If not the field is transformed into the current map.

2)Included routines ij2lb, lb2ij and ij2ij in GridValues_ml.

3)Moved routine inpar and array iclass from GridValues to DryDep

4)Moved  "call inpar" from GridValues to Unimod.f90

5)inpar: explicit loop instead of (:)

6)Commented out routine and call SetZ0 (never used)

7)Changed formula for precipitations (pr) when not found (MM5 case),
  defined V_RAIN in PhysicalConstants_ml

8)Changed 2 last decimals of PI in PhysicalConstants_ml

9)Dates_ml: add_dates_s : Allow to add 3600 seconds (before 3599 was
  largest allowed).

10)Print max Courant number in Advection_ml

11)(Changed by Hilde) Loop for skh in Met_ml kx2,KMAX (instead of kx1,KMAX), and z_mid(i,j,k-1)

12)Tabulations : use T0 from PhysicalConstants

13)Rsurface.f90 :(Changed by Dave) /D_i instead of /diffc

14)grun.pl Included an if test in loop for meteo files

15)included a DEBUG compiler option in Makefile

16)commented out a declaration (amax,amin)

17)Commented out call to smoosp. The routine is not well parallelized.

18)replaced izen x int ( zen(i,j) + 0.5 ) by  izen x max(1,int ( zen(i,j) + 0.5 )) in Setup_1d_ml

19)Jej: My_derived_ml commented out O3x ... !/ (roa ...)

20)Corrected a small bug in advvk in Advection_ml

21)Removed an amax1(.,.) in tiphys (Met_ml)

22)Include  -TARG:exc_minxOZV as compiler option. This will stop the execution if
   wrong operations are done (such as 0/0 , NaN ).
