# PPM25 splits for EmChem09
# Key-word, MASS_ASSUMED= 0 by default, 
# Here we simply split SNAP-2 equally between wood and ffuel. Should
# be done in more detail
# D. Simpson, May 2011, loosely based upon IIASA, POMI, CARBOSOL papers
# change when emissions have artificial mass, e.g. 46 for NOx as NO2
