This directory contains two examples of programs that use m1qn3 as an
optimization solver, namely 'essai' (a 2 variable quadratic function)
and 'u1mt1' (shallow water equation). Both direct or reverse
communication can be used and the code corresponding to the latter
communication protocol is referenced by the suffix '_rc'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using the Makefile in this 'example' directory, you must define
a file in the 'm1qn3' directory (or a symbolic link to it), that
defines the compiler name and options, as well as other variables used
by Makefile. Before starting to work, the Makefile includes indeed the
file

   ../make.$PLAT
   
where $PLAT is en environment variable that identifies the platform and
must be set to some string. An example of such a make.$PLAT file is

   ../make.a_platform

The 'm1qn3' solver uses a single BLAS routine, namely 'ddot'. If not
present in the archive ../bin.libblas.$PLAT.a, the Makefile will use the
option '-blas' to load it from a standard library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run one of these examples, type

  rm -f res
  make EXAMPLE
  EXAMPLE > res
  diff EXAMPLE.res res

where EXAMPLE stands for one of the following string/program:

  essai
  essai_wr
  essai_rc
  essai_rc_wr
  u1mt1
  u1mt1_rc

where the suffix 'rc' refers to 'reverse communication ' and 'wr' to
'warm restart'. The third command line above puts the result in the file
'res'. The 'diff' command should not show much differences between the
result in 'res' and those in 'EXAMPLE.res', which have been obtained by
the authors of the archive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By typing

  make clean

you remove the generated files, hence cleaning up the example
directory.
