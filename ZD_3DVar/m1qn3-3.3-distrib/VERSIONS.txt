             Enhancements in successive versions of M1QN3


Version 3.3 : October 2009

   1. Reverse communication in now better monitored by the variables
      'reverse' (now an integer) and 'indic'.

   2. Free call to the simulator is now controlled by imode(3) (no
      longer a negative value of 'impres').

   3. Bugs corrected:
      - a benign one,
      - another when the simulator requires stopping at the first call
        and a warm restart is asked next (m1qn3 used to refuse
        restarting).

   4. Examples with warm restarts have been added in the directory
      'examples': essai_wr.f (in direct communication) and essai_rc_wr.f
      (in reverse communication).
      
   5. Modifications in the documentation.


Version 3.2 : December 2008

   1. The software is now distributed under the GNU General Public
      License.

   2. The norm of the gradient that is used to test optimality can now
      be the Euclidean norm, the infinity (or sup) norm, or the norm
      associated with the scalar product defined by the 'prosca' inner
      product subroutine (previous option).

      As a consequence, the argument 'normtype' has been added.

   3. The contents of the package has been divided in directories. The
      directories 'cuter' and 'libopt' have been introduced to make
      easier the installation of 'm1qn3' into the corresponding
      environments.

   4. A FAQ section has been included in the documentation.


Version 3.1 : June 2006

   1. The statement 'save' has now arguments, which is important for
      some compilers.
   
   2. Line 79 used to have more than 72 characters.

   3. Statement 'implicit none' is now used systematically (strange
      that this was not already so).


Version 3.0 : March 2005

   1. Can be used in direct or reverse communication.
   
   2. The single precision version has been abandonned. Only the double
      precision version, now called M1QN3, is maintained.


Version 2.0e : December 2000

   1. Parameter "mode" has been split in "imode" (input mode) and
      "omode" (outpout mode). Parameter "imode" is now a vector
      (instead of a scalar) and each of its two components has a
      particular meaning (instead of each of its bits).


Version 2.0d : July 1996

   1. Wolfe's parameter has been set to 0.99 (instead of 0.9) to
      accelerate acceptance of the step by the line-search routine
      (mlis0).

   2. Some minor `bugs' fixed or modifications brought.


Version 2.0c : June 1995

   1. The meaning of the argument IMPRES has slightly changed when it
      has a negative value. M1QN3 still acts silently but every -IMPRES
      iteration, it begins by calling the simulator with INDIC=1.
      Previously, the iteration consisted in this call only. A bug is
      fixed (there was no stop on NITER if IMPRES<0 and
      mode(NITER,-IMPRES)=0).


Version 2.0b : December 1993

   1. The input parameter niter is now used as the iteration counter
      inside M1QN3, so that the user can have access to this counter by
      looking at the value of this variable, owned by the user.

   2. Small modification in mlis0 (LS routine) to accelerate
      termination in case of a suspected output in mode 6.


Version 2.0 : March 1993

   1. M1QN2 and M1QN3 have now been merged in a single module, called
      M1QN3. The previous versions can be run by setting appropriately
      the entry argument `mode' when calling M1QN3: the SIS running
      mode corresponds to the old M1QN2 and the DIS running mode
      corresponds to the old M1QN3.

      The calling statements of M1QN3 and MUPDTS have changed:
      - M1QN3: new integer argument IZ(5) and new input meaning for
        MODE,
      - MUPDTS: new logical argument SSCALE.

   2. N1QN3 is the double precision version of the new M1QN3 module.

   3. M1QN3 has also two starting modes: cold start or warm restart.

   4. The routines incorporate the `very large scale option' of the
      former m1qn3-b module.

   See the new write-up for more information (m1qn3.tex file).


Version 1.2b : February 1992

   Introduction of the routines MUPDTS and YSTBL in the `b' version of
   m1qn3 (m1qn3-b.f). By changing these routines, the user can store on
   an auxilliary device the pairs (y,s) used to construct the current
   metrics. This allows a reduction of the working storage of m1qn3
   from 4*n+(2*n+1)*m to 6*n+m, where n is the number of variables and
   m the number of updates.

   These modifications have not been made in the double precision
   version of m1qn3-b (n1qn3.f) nor in other versions (m1qn3-a.f,
   m1qn2.f, n1qn2.f).


Version 1.1b : February 1989

   M1qn3-b can use any scalar product provided by the user. M1qn3-a
   still requires the use of the Euclidean scalar product.


Version 1.1 : December 1988

   New version of `mlis0': systematic cubic interpolation and
   anti-overflows.


Version 1.0 : Septembre 1988

   Initial version of m1qn2 and n1qn2.
