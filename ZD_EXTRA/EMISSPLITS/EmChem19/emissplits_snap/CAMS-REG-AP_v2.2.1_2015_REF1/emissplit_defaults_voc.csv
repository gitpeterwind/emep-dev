# VOC splits for snap sectors and EmChem19a -- Robert & Dave Jan-Jun 2020
# Merges CAMS 25-compounds (v01...) from CAMS-REG-v3_1_2 matrix and
# F1-F4 splits for road traffic and K-L for agriculture from CAMS-REG-AP_v2.2.1 for 2015
# created by camsmakeNMVOCsplits.py Jun 2020 and earlier mkEC19emissplitMCM.py.
# Note - two changes to keep C5H8 and terpenes as BVOC only:
#  moved trace amounts of apinene to 50%  C2H4 and 50% unreactive. 
#  moved trace amounts of isoprene to C2H4.
# Key-word, MASS_ASSUMED= 0 by default,
# change when emissions have artificial mass, e.g. 46 for NOx as NO2
: MASS_ASSUMED 0
